# Area Data and Spatial Autcorrelation

Areal units of observation are very often used when simultaneous observations are aggregated within non-overlapping boundaries. The boundaries may be those of administrative entities, and may be related to underlying spatial processes, such as commuting flows, but are usually arbitrary. If they do not match the underlying and unobserved spatial processes in one or more variables of interest, proximate areal units will contain parts of the underlying processes, engendering spatial autocorrelation. This is at least in part because the aggregated observations are driven by factors which may or may not themselves have been observed.
