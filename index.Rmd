# Preface {-}

This book aims at data scientists using R who want to get a grip
on using spatial data in their analysis. It is often thought
that spatial data boils down to having observations' longitude
and latitude in a dataset, and treating them just like any other
variable. This carries the risk of meaningless analyses, and missed
opportunities. For instance,

* coordinate pairs really are pairs, and loose much of their meaning 
when treated separately
* rather than having point locations, observations are often 
associated with spatial lines, areas, or grid cells
* spatial distances between observations are often not well
represented by straight-line distances, but by great circle
distances, distances through networks, or by the effort it takes
to get from A to B

We introduce the concepts behind spatial data, coordinate reference
systems, spatial analysis, and introduce a number of packages,
including `sf` [@rjsf, @R-sf], `lwgeom` [@R-lwgeom], and `stars` [@R-stars],
as well as a number of `tidyverse` [@R-tidyverse] extensions, and a number of
spatial analysis packages that use can be used with these packages,
including `gstat` [@R-gstat], `spdep` [@R-spdep] and `spatstat` [@R-spatstat].
