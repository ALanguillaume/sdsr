# Preface {-}

Data science is concerned with finding answers to questions on the
basis of available data, and communitating that effort. Besides
showing the results, this communication involves sharing the data
used, but also exposing the path that led to the answers in a
comprehensive and reproducible way.

This book introduces and explaining the concepts underlying
_spatial_ data: points, lines, polygons, rasters, coverages, geometry
attributes, data cubes, reference systems, as well as higher-level
concepts including how attributes relate to geometries and how
this affects analysis, and how we analyse discrete processes (point
processes), continuous processes (geostatistics), and areal data.
The book aims at data scientists who want to get a grip on using
spatial data in their analysis. To exemplify how to do things,
it uses R.

It is often thought that spatial data boils down to having
observations' longitude and latitude in a dataset, and treating these
just like any other variable. This carries the risk of missed 
opportunities and meaningless analyses. For instance,

* coordinate pairs really are pairs, and loose much of their meaning 
when treated separately
* rather than having point locations, observations are often 
associated with spatial lines, areas, or grid cells
* spatial distances between observations are often not well
represented by straight-line distances, but by great circle
distances, distances through networks, or by measuring the effort
it takes to get from A to B

We introduce the concepts behind spatial data, coordinate reference
systems, spatial analysis, and introduce a number of packages,
including `sf` [@rjsf, @R-sf], `lwgeom` [@R-lwgeom], and `stars` [@R-stars],
as well as a number of `tidyverse` [@R-tidyverse] extensions, and a number of
spatial analysis packages that use can be used with these packages,
including `gstat` [@R-gstat], `spdep` [@R-spdep] and `spatstat` [@R-spatstat]. Where appropriate, we will indicate which functions or methods were used in earlier representations of spatial data in R [@asdar].
