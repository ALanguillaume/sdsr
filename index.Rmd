# Preface {-}

This book aims at data scientists using R who want to get a grip
on using spatial data in their analysis. It is often thought that
spatial data boils down to having observations' longitude and
latitude in a dataset, and treating them just like any other.  This
carries the risk of meaningless analyses, and missed opportunities:

* coordinate pairs really are pairs, and loose much of their meaning 
when treated separately
* rather than having point locations, observations are often 
associated with spatial lines, areas, or grid cells
* spatial distances between observations are often not well
represented by straight-line distances, but by great circle
distances, distances through networks, or by the effort it takes
to get from A to B

We introduce the concepts behind spatial data, coordinate reference
systems, spatial analysis, and introduce two new packages, `sf`
and `stars`, to do this.
