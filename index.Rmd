# Preface {-}

This book aims at data scientists who want to get a grip on using
spatial data in their analysis. To exemplify how to do things, it
uses R. It is often thought that spatial data boils down to having
observations' longitude and latitude in a dataset, and treating them
just like any other variable. This carries the risk of missed 
opportunities and meaningless analyses. For instance,

* coordinate pairs really are pairs, and loose much of their meaning 
when treated separately
* rather than having point locations, observations are often 
associated with spatial lines, areas, or grid cells
* spatial distances between observations are often not well
represented by straight-line distances, but by great circle
distances, distances through networks, or by the effort it takes
to get from A to B

We introduce the concepts behind spatial data, coordinate reference
systems, spatial analysis, and introduce a number of packages,
including `sf` [@rjsf, @R-sf], `lwgeom` [@R-lwgeom], and `stars` [@R-stars],
as well as a number of `tidyverse` [@R-tidyverse] extensions, and a number of
spatial analysis packages that use can be used with these packages,
including `gstat` [@R-gstat], `spdep` [@R-spdep] and `spatstat` [@R-spatstat].
