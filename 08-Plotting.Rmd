# (PART) Maps {-}

# Plotting spatial data

Together with timelines, maps belong to the most powerful graphs,
perhaps because we can immediately relate where we are, or have
been, on the space of the plot. Two recent books on visualisation
[@Healy, @Wilke] contain chapters on visualising geospatial data or
maps. Here, we will not try to preach the do's and don'ts of maps,
but rather point out a number of possibilities how to do things,
point out challenges along the way and ways to mitigate them.
