[["index.html", "Spatial Data Science Preface", " Spatial Data Science Edzer Pebesma, Roger Bivand 2021-02-15 Preface Data science is concerned with finding answers to questions on the basis of available data, and communicating that effort. Besides showing the results, this communication involves sharing the data used, but also exposing the path that led to the answers in a comprehensive and reproducible way. It also acknowledges the fact that available data may not be sufficient to answer questions, and that any answers are conditional on the data collection or sampling protocols employed. This book introduces and explains the concepts underlying spatial data: points, lines, polygons, rasters, coverages, geometry attributes, data cubes, reference systems, as well as higher-level concepts including how attributes relate to geometries and how this affects analysis. The relationship of attributes to geometries is known as support, and changing support also changes the characteristics of attributes. Some data generation processes are continuous in space, and may be observed everywhere. Others are discrete, observed in tesselated containers. In modern spatial data analysis, tesellated methods are often used for all data, extending across the legacy partition into point process, geostatistical and lattice models. It is support (and the understanding of support) that underlies the importance of spatial representation. The book aims at data scientists who want to get a grip on using spatial data in their analysis. To exemplify how to do things, it uses R. It is often thought that spatial data boils down to having observations’ longitude and latitude in a dataset, and treating these just like any other variable. This carries the risk of missed opportunities and meaningless analyses. For instance, coordinate pairs really are pairs, and lose much of their meaning when treated independently rather than having point locations, observations are often associated with spatial lines, areas, or grid cells spatial distances between observations are often not well represented by straight-line distances, but by great circle distances, distances through networks, or by measuring the effort it takes getting from A to B We introduce the concepts behind spatial data, coordinate reference systems, spatial analysis, and introduce a number of packages, including sf (Pebesma 2018, @R-sf), stars (Pebesma 2020c), s2 (Dunnington, Pebesma, and Rubak 2020) and lwgeom (Pebesma 2020a), as well as a number of tidyverse (Wickham 2019) extensions, and a number of spatial analysis and visualisation packages that can be used with these packages, including gstat (Pebesma and Graeler 2021), spdep (R. Bivand 2020b), spatstat (Baddeley, Turner, and Rubak 2018), tmap (Tennekes 2021) and mapview (Appelhans et al. 2020).

The code sections in this chapter should be easy to follow when understanding R at the level of, say, R for Data Science (Wickham and Grolemund 2017). 1.1 A first map The typical way to graph spatial data is by creating a map. Let us consider a simple map: library(tidyverse) library(sf) system.file(&quot;gpkg/nc.gpkg&quot;, package=&quot;sf&quot;) %&gt;% read_sf() -&gt; nc nc.32119 &lt;- st_transform(nc, 32119) nc.32119 %&gt;% select(BIR74) %&gt;% plot(graticule = TRUE, axes = TRUE) Figure 1.1: a first map A number of graphical elements are present, in this case: polygons are drawn, and colored according to a variable BIR74, whose name is in the title a legend key explains the meaning of the colors, and has a certain color palette and color breaks, values at which color changes the background of the map shows curved lines with constant latitude or longitude (graticules) the axis ticks show the latitude and longitude values Polygons are a particular form of geometry; spatial geometries (points, lines, polygons, pixels) are discussed in detail in chapter 3. Polygons consist of sequences of points, connected by straight lines. How point locations of spatial data are expressed, or measured, is discussed in chapter 2. As can be seen from figure 1.1, lines of equal latitude and longitude do not form straight lines, indicating that some form of projection took place before plotting; projections are also discussed in chapter 2 and section 9.1. The color values in figure 1.1 are derived from numeric values of a variable, BIR74, which has a single value assocated with each geometry or feature. Chapter 5 discusses such feature attributes, and the way they can relate to feature geometries. In this case, BIR74 refers to birth counts, meaning counts over the region. This implies that the count does not refer to a value associated with every point inside the polygon, which the continuous color might suggest, but rather measures an integral (sum) over the polygon. Before plotting figure 1.1 we had to read the data, in this case from a file (section ??). Printing a data summary for the first three records of three attribute variables shows: nc %&gt;% select(AREA, BIR74, SID74) %&gt;% print(n = 3) # Simple feature collection with 100 features and 3 fields # geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON # dimension: XY # bbox: xmin: -84.3 ymin: 33.9 xmax: -75.5 ymax: 36.6 # geographic CRS: NAD27 # # A tibble: 100 x 4 # AREA BIR74 SID74 geom # &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;MULTIPOLYGON [°]&gt; # 1 0.114 1091 1 (((-81.5 36.2, -81.5 36.3, -81.6 36.3, -81.6 36.3, -81.7 36… # 2 0.061 487 0 (((-81.2 36.4, -81.2 36.4, -81.3 36.4, -81.3 36.4, -81.3 36… # 3 0.143 3188 5 (((-80.5 36.2, -80.5 36.3, -80.5 36.3, -80.5 36.3, -80.6 36… # # … with 97 more rows The printed output shows the (selected) dataset has 100 features (records) and 3 fields (attributes) the geometry type is MULTIPOLYGON (chapter 3) it has dimension XY, indicating that each point will consist of 2 coordinate values the range of x and y values of the geometry the coordinate reference system is geographic, indicating that coordinates are degrees longitude and latitude, with reference to the NAD27 datum (chapter 8) the three selected attribute variables are followed by a variable geom of type MULTIPOLYGON with unit degrees that contains the polygon information More complicated plots can involve facet plots with a map in each facet, as shown in figure 1.2. year_labels = c(&quot;SID74&quot; = &quot;1974 - 1978&quot;, &quot;SID79&quot; = &quot;1979 - 1984&quot;) nc.32119 %&gt;% select(SID74, SID79) %&gt;% gather(VAR, SID, -geom) -&gt; nc2 ggplot() + geom_sf(data = nc2, aes(fill = SID)) + facet_wrap(~VAR, ncol = 1, labeller = labeller(VAR = year_labels)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = 34:36) + scale_fill_gradientn(colors = sf.colors(20)) + theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(color = &quot;white&quot;)) Figure 1.2: ggplot with facet maps An interactive, leaflet-based map is obtained in figure ??. suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(mapview)) nc.32119 %&gt;% mapview(zcol = &quot;BIR74&quot;, legend = TRUE, col.regions = sf.colors) 1.2 Coordinate reference systems In figure ??, the grey lines denote graticules, lines with constant latitude or longitude. Clearly, these lines are not straight, which indicates that a projection of the data was used for which the x and y axis do not align with longitude and latitude. In figure ?? we see that the north boundary of North Carolina is plotted as a straight line again, indicating that another projection was used. The underlying geographical coordinates, depicted by the graticules of figure ??, are associated with a particular datum (here: NAD27), which implicates a set of rules what the shape of the Earth is and how it is attached to the Earth (to which point of the Earth is the origin associated, and how is it directed). If one would measure coordinates with a GPS device (e.g. a mobile phone) it would typically report coordinates associated with the WGS84 datum, and be around 30 m different from the identical coordinates numbers when associated with NAD27. Projections describe how we go back and forth between geographical coordinates which are expressed as degrees latitude and longitude, pointing to locations on a shape approximating the Earth’s shape (an ellipsoid or spheroid), and projected coordinates which are coordinates on a flat, two-dimensional coordinate system, used when plotting maps. Datums transformations are associated with moving from one datum to another. Both topics are covered by spatial reference systems are described in more detail in chapter 8. 1.3 Raster and vector data Polygon, point and line geometries are examples of vector data: point coordinates describe the “exact” locations that can be anywhere. Raster data on the other hand describe data where values are aligned on a raster, meaning on a regularly laid out lattice of usually square pixels. An example is shown in figure 1.3. library(stars) par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) par(mar = rep(1, 4)) tif &lt;- system.file(&quot;tif/L7_ETMs.tif&quot;, package = &quot;stars&quot;) x &lt;- read_stars(tif)[,,,1] image(x, main = &quot;(a)&quot;) image(x[,1:10,1:10], text_values = TRUE, border = &#39;grey&#39;, main = &quot;(b)&quot;) image(x, main = &quot;(c)&quot;) set.seed(131) pts = st_sample(st_as_sfc(st_bbox(x)), 3) plot(pts, add = TRUE, pch = 3, col = &#39;blue&#39;) image(x, main = &quot;(d)&quot;) plot(st_buffer(pts, 500), add = TRUE, pch = 3, border = &#39;blue&#39;, col = NA, lwd = 2) Figure 1.3: raster maps: Landsat-7 blue band, with color values derived from data values (a), the top-left 10x10 sub-image from (a) with numeric values shown (b), and overlayed by two different types of vector data: three sample points (c), and a 500m radius around the points represented as polygons (d) Vector and raster data can be combined in different ways; for instance we can query the raster at the three points of figure 1.3(c), st_extract(x, pts) # Simple feature collection with 3 features and 1 field # geometry type: POINT # dimension: XY # bbox: xmin: 290000 ymin: 9110000 xmax: 292000 ymax: 9120000 # projected CRS: UTM Zone 25, Southern Hemisphere # L7_ETMs.tif geometry # 1 80 POINT (290830 9114499) # 2 58 POINT (290019 9119219) # 3 63 POINT (291693 9116038) or compute an aggregate, such as the average, over arbitrary regions such as the circles shown in figure 1.3(d): aggregate(x, st_buffer(pts, 500), FUN = mean) %&gt;% st_as_sf() # Simple feature collection with 3 features and 1 field # geometry type: POLYGON # dimension: XY # bbox: xmin: 290000 ymin: 9110000 xmax: 292000 ymax: 9120000 # projected CRS: UTM Zone 25, Southern Hemisphere # V1 geometry # 1 77.2 POLYGON ((291330 9114499, 2... # 2 60.1 POLYGON ((290519 9119219, 2... # 3 71.6 POLYGON ((292193 9116038, 2... Other raster-to-vector conversions are discussed in ?? and include converting raster pixels in point values converting raster pixels into small polygons, possibly merging polygons with identical values (polygonize) generating lines or polygons that delineate continuous pixel areas with a certain value range (contouring) plot(st_rasterize(nc[&quot;BIR74&quot;], dx = 0.1), col =sf.colors(), breaks = &quot;equal&quot;) Figure 1.4: The map obtained by rasterizing county total number of births for the period 1974-1979 shown in figure 1.1 Vector-to-raster conversions can be as simple as rasterizing polygons, as shown in figure 1.4. Other, more general vector-to-raster conversions include interpolation of point values to points on a regular grid (chapter ??) estimating densities of points over a regular grid (chapter 13) area-weighted interpolation of polygon values to grid cells (section ??) direct rasterization of points, lines or polygons (section @(rasterize)) 1.4 Raster types Raster dimensions describe how the rows and columns relate to spatial coordinates. Figure ?? shows a number of different possibilities. x = 1:5 y = 1:4 d = st_dimensions(x = x, y = y, .raster = c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;)) m = matrix(runif(20),5,4) r1 = st_as_stars(r = m, dimensions = d) r = attr(d, &quot;raster&quot;) r$affine = c(0.2, -0.2) attr(d, &quot;raster&quot;) = r r2 = st_as_stars(r = m, dimensions = d) r = attr(d, &quot;raster&quot;) r$affine = c(0.1, -0.3) attr(d, &quot;raster&quot;) = r r3 = st_as_stars(r = m, dimensions = d) x = c(1, 2, 3.5, 5, 6) y = c(1, 1.5, 3, 3.5) d = st_dimensions(x = x, y = y, .raster = c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;)) r4 = st_as_stars(r = m, dimensions = d) grd = st_make_grid(cellsize = c(10,10), offset = c(-130,10), n= c(8,5), crs=st_crs(4326)) r5 = st_transform(grd, &quot;+proj=laea +lon_0=-70 +lat_0=35&quot;) par(mfrow = c(2,3), mar = c(0.1, 1, 1.1, 1)) r1 = st_make_grid(cellsize = c(1,1), n = c(5,4), offset = c(0,0)) plot(r1, main = &quot;regular&quot;) plot(st_geometry(st_as_sf(r2)), main = &quot;rotated&quot;) plot(st_geometry(st_as_sf(r3)), main = &quot;sheared&quot;) plot(st_geometry(st_as_sf(r4, as_points = FALSE)), main = &quot;rectilinear&quot;) plot(st_geometry((r5)), main = &quot;curvilinear&quot;) Figure 1.5: various raster types Regular rasters like shown in figure ?? have a constant, not necessarily square cell size and axes aligned with the x and y (Easting and Northing) axes. Other raster types include those where the axes are no longer aligned with x and y (rotated), where axes are no longer perpendicular (sheared), or where cell size varies along a dimension (rectilinear). Finally, curvilinear rasters have cellsize and/or direction properties that are no longer independent from the other raster dimension. When a raster that is regular in a given projection is projected to another raster while keeping each raster cells in tact, it changes shape and may become rectilinear (e.g. from geographic to Mercator, as in figure ??) or curvilinear (e.g. from geographic to Lambert Conic Conformal, as in figure ??). When reverting this procedure, one can recover the exact original raster. Creating a new, regular grid in the new projection is called raster (or image) reprojection or warping (section ??). This process is lossy, irreversible, and may need to be informed whether raster cells can be interpolated, averaged or summed, or whether they denote categorical variables; see also section 1.6. 1.5 Time series, arrays, data cubes A lot of spatial data is not just spatial, but in addition temporal. Just like any observation is associated with an observation location, it is associated with an observation time or period. The dataset on the North Carolina counties shown above contains disease cases counted over two time periods, shown in figure 1.2. Although the original dataset has these variables in two different columns, for plotting them these columns had to be stacked first, while repeating the associated geometries - a form called tidy by (Wickham 2014b). When we have longer time series associated with geometries, neither option - distributing time over multiple columns, or stacking columns while repeating geometries - works well, and a more effective way of storing such data would be a matrix, where one dimension refers to time, and the other to space. The natural way for image or raster data is alreay to store them in matrices; time series of rasters then lead to a three-dimensional array. The general term for such data is a (spatiotemporal) data cube, where cube refers to arrays with any number of dimensions. Data cubes can refer to both raster and vector data, examples are given in chapter 6. 1.6 Support When we have spatial data with geometries that are not points but collections of points (multi-points, lines, polygons, pixels), then the attributes associated with these geometries has one of several different relationships to them. Attributes can have a constant value for every point of the geometry a value that is unique to only this geometry, describing its identity a single value that is an aggregate over all points of the geometry An example of a constant is land use or bedrock type of a polygon. An example of an identity is a county name. An example of an aggregate is the number of births over a given period of time, of a county. The area with to which an attribute value refers to is called support: aggregate properties have block (or polygon, or line) support, constant properties have point support (they apply to every point). Support matters when we manipulate the data. For instance, figure ?? was derived from a variable that has polygon support: the number of births per county. Rasterizing these values gives pixels with values that are associated to counties. The result of the rasterization is a meaningless map: the numeric values (“birth totals”) are not associated with the raster cells, and the county boundaries are lost. Totals of birth for the whole state can no longer be recovered from the pixel values. Ignoring support can easily lead to meaningless results. Chapter 5 discusses this further. Raster cell values may have point support, e.g. when the cell records the elevation of the point at the cell centre in a digital elevation model, or cell support, e.g. when a satellite image pixel gives the color value averaged over (an area similar to the) pixel. Most file formats do not provide this information, yet it may be important to know when aggregating, regridding or warping rasters (section @ref{warp}). 1.7 Spatial data science software Although this book largely uses R and R packages for spatial data science, a number of these packages use software libraries that were not developed for R specifically. As an example, the dependency of R package sf on other R packages and system libraries is shown in figure 1.6. Figure 1.6: sf and its dependencies; arrows indicate strong dependency, dashed arrows weak dependency The C or C++ libraries used (GDAL, GEOS, PROJ, liblwgeom, s2geometry, netcdf, udunits2) are all developed, maintained and used by (spatial) data science communities that are large and mostly different from the R community. By using these libraries, we share how we understand what we are doing with these other communities. Because R, Python and Julia provide interactive interfaces to this software, many users get closer to these libraries than do users of other software based on these libraries. The first part of this book describes the concepts implemented in these libraries, and although R is dominantly used to construct examples, it has relevance to spatial data science in general. 1.7.1 GDAL GDAL (geospatial data abstraction library) can be seen as the Swiss army knive of spatial data; besides for R it is being used in Python, QGIS, PostGIS, and more than 100 other software projects. GDAL is a “library of libraries” – in order to read all these data sources it needs a large number of other libraries. It typically links to over 100 other libraries, each of which provides access to e.g. a particular data file format, database access, or web service. Binary R packages distributed by CRAN contain only statically linked code: CRAN does not want to make any assumptions about presence of third-party libraries on the host system. As a consequence, when the sf package is installed in binary form from CRAN, it includes a copy of all the required external libraries as well as their dependencies, which may amount to 100 Mb. 1.7.2 PROJ PROJ is a library for cartographic projections and datum transformations: it converts spatial coordinates from one coordinate reference system to another. It comes with a large database of known projections and access to datum grids (high-precision pre-calculated values for datum transformations). It aligns with an international standard for coordinate reference systems (Lott 2015). Chapter 8 details more about coordinate systems. 1.7.3 GEOS and s2geometry GEOS (“Geometry Engine Open Source”) and s2geometry are two libraries for geometric operations. They are used to find measures (length, area, distance), and calculate predicates (do two geometries have any points in common?) or new geometries (which points do these two geometries have in common?). GEOS does this for flat, two-dimensional space (indicated by \\(R^2\\)), s2geometry does this for geometries on the sphere (indicated by \\(S^2\\)). Chapter 2 discusses more about the differences between working with these two spaces. 1.7.4 netcdf, udunits2, liblwgeom NetCDF (UCAR 2020) refers to a file format as well as a C library for reading and writing netcdf files. It allows the definition of arrays of any dimensionality, and is widely used for spatial and spatiotemporal information, especially in the (climate) modelling communities. Udunits2 (UCAR 2014; Pebesma, Mailund, and Kalinowski 2020) is a database and software library for units of measurement that allows the conversion of units, handles derived units, and supports user-defined units. The liblwgeom “library” is a software component of PostGIS (Obe and Hsu 2015) that contains several routines missing from GDAL or GEOS, including convenient access to GeographicLib routines (Karney 2013) that ship with PROJ. 1.8 Exercises What are the differences between raster and vector data? Which components of a map can you list? In your own words, why is the numeric information shown in figure 1.4 misleading (or meaningless)? When and where would you expect strong differences when doing geometrical operations on \\(S^2\\), compared to doing them on \\(R^2\\)?

For spatial data, the location of observations are characterised by coordinates, and coordinates are defined in a coordinate system. Different coordinate systems can be used for this, and the most important difference is whether coordinates are defined over a 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional space referenced to orthogonal axes (Cartesian coordinates), or using distance and directions (polar coordinates, spherical and ellipsoidal coordinates). Besides a location of observation, all observations are associated with time of observation, and so time coordinate systems are also briefly discussed. 2.1 Polar and Cartesian coordinates par(mar = rep(0,4)) plot(3, 4, xlim = c(-6,6), ylim = c(-6,6), asp = 1) axis(1, pos = 0, at = 0:6) axis(2, pos = 0, at = -6:6) xd = seq(-5, 5, by = .1) lines(xd, sqrt(25 - xd^2), col = &#39;grey&#39;) lines(xd, -sqrt(25 - xd^2), col = &#39;grey&#39;) arrows(0, 0, 3, 4, col = &#39;red&#39;, length = .15, angle = 20) text(1.5, 2.7, label = &quot;r&quot;, col = &#39;red&#39;) xd = seq(3/5, 1, by = .1) lines(xd, sqrt(1 - xd^2), col = &#39;red&#39;) text(1.2, 0.5, label = parse(text = &quot;phi&quot;), col = &#39;red&#39;) lines(c(3,3), c(0,4), lty = 2, col = &#39;blue&#39;) lines(c(0,3), c(4,4), lty = 2, col = &#39;blue&#39;) text(3.3, 0.3, label = &quot;x&quot;, col = &#39;blue&#39;) text(0.3, 4.3, label = &quot;y&quot;, col = &#39;blue&#39;) Figure 2.1: Two-dimensional polar (red) and Cartesian (blue) coordinates Figure 2.1 shows both polar and Cartesian coordinates for a two-dimensional situation. In Cartesian coordinates, the point shown is \\((x,y) = (3,4)\\), for polar coordinates it is \\((r,\\phi) = (5, \\mbox{arctan}(4/3))\\), where \\(\\mbox{arctan}(4/3)\\) is approximately \\(0.93\\) radians, or \\(53^{\\circ}\\). Note that \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(r\\) all have length units, where \\(\\phi\\) is an angle (a unitless length/length ratio). Converting back and forth between Cartesian and polar coordinates is trivial, as \\[x = r~\\mbox{cos} \\phi,\\] \\[y = r~\\mbox{sin} \\phi,\\] \\[r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \\ \\mbox{and}\\] \\[\\phi = \\mbox{atan2}(y, x)\\] where \\(\\mbox{atan2}\\) is used in favor of \\(\\mbox{atan}(y/x)\\) to take care of the right quadrant. 2.2 Ellipsoidal coordinates In three dimensions, where Cartesian coordinates are expressed as \\((x,y,z)\\), spherical coordinates are the three-dimensional equivalent of polar coordinates and can be expressed as \\((r,\\lambda,\\phi)\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the sphere, \\(\\lambda\\) is the longitude, measured in the \\((x,y)\\) plane counter-clockwise from positive \\(x\\), and \\(\\phi\\) is the latitude, the angle between the vector and the \\((x,y)\\) plane. Figure 2.2 illustrates Cartesian geocentric and geographic coordinates. suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(sf)) e = cbind(-90:90,0) # equator f1 = rbind(cbind(0, -90:90)) # 0/antimerid. f2 = rbind(cbind(90, -90:90), cbind(270, 90:-90))# +/- 90 eq = st_sfc(st_linestring(e), st_linestring(f1), st_linestring(f2), crs=4326) geoc = st_transform(eq, &quot;+proj=geocent&quot;) cc = rbind(geoc[[1]], NA, geoc[[2]], NA, geoc[[3]]) from3d = function(x, offset, maxz, minz) { x = x[,c(2,3,1)] + offset # move to y right, x up, z backw x[,2] = x[,2] - maxz # shift y to left d = maxz z = x[,3] - minz + offset x[,1] = x[,1] * (d/z) x[,2] = x[,2] * (d/z) x[,1:2] } maxz = max(cc[,3], na.rm = TRUE) minz = min(cc[,3], na.rm = TRUE) offset = 3e7 circ = from3d(cc, offset, maxz, minz) mx = max(cc, na.rm = TRUE) * 1.1 x = rbind(c(0, 0, 0), c(mx, 0, 0)) y = rbind(c(0, 0, 0), c(0, mx, 0)) z = rbind(c(0, 0, 0), c(0, 0, mx)) ll = rbind(x, NA, y, NA, z) l0 = from3d(ll, offset, maxz, minz) mx = max(cc, na.rm = TRUE) * 1.2 x = rbind(c(0, 0, 0), c(mx, 0, 0)) y = rbind(c(0, 0, 0), c(0, mx, 0)) z = rbind(c(0, 0, 0), c(0, 0, mx)) ll = rbind(x, NA, y, NA, z) l = from3d(ll, offset, maxz, minz) par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) par(mar=rep(0,4)) plot.new() plot.window(xlim = c(min(circ[,1],na.rm = TRUE), 3607103*1.02), ylim = c(min(circ[,2],na.rm = TRUE), 2873898*1.1), asp = 1) lines(circ) lines(l0) text(l[c(2,5,8),], labels = c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;), col = &#39;red&#39;) # add POINT(60 47) p = st_as_sfc(&quot;POINT(60 47)&quot;, crs = 4326) %&gt;% st_transform(&quot;+proj=geocent&quot;) p = p[[1]] pts = rbind(c(0,0,0), c(p[1],0,0), c(p[1],p[2],0), c(p[1],p[2],p[2])) ptsl = from3d(pts, offset, maxz, minz) lines(ptsl, col = &#39;blue&#39;, lty = 2, lwd = 2) points(ptsl[4,1], ptsl[4,2], col = &#39;blue&#39;, cex = 1, pch = 16) plot.new() plot.window(xlim = c(min(circ[,1],na.rm = TRUE), 3607103*1.02), ylim = c(min(circ[,2],na.rm = TRUE), 2873898*1.1), asp = 1) lines(circ) p = st_as_sfc(&quot;POINT(60 47)&quot;, crs = 4326) %&gt;% st_transform(&quot;+proj=geocent&quot;) p = p[[1]] pts = rbind(c(0,0,0), c(p[1],p[2],p[3])) pt = from3d(pts, offset, maxz, minz) lines(pt) points(pt[2,1], pt[2,2], col = &#39;blue&#39;, cex = 1, pch = 16) p0 = st_as_sfc(&quot;POINT(60 0)&quot;, crs = 4326) %&gt;% st_transform(&quot;+proj=geocent&quot;) p0 = p0[[1]] pts = rbind(c(0,0,0), c(p0[1],p0[2],p0[3])) pt = from3d(pts, offset, maxz, minz) lines(pt) p0 = st_as_sfc(&quot;POINT(0 0)&quot;, crs = 4326) %&gt;% st_transform(&quot;+proj=geocent&quot;) p0 = p0[[1]] pts = rbind(c(0,0,0), c(p0[1],p0[2],p0[3])) pt = from3d(pts, offset, maxz, minz) lines(pt) p0 = st_as_sfc(&quot;POINT(0 90)&quot;, crs = 4326) %&gt;% st_transform(&quot;+proj=geocent&quot;) p0 = p0[[1]] pts = rbind(c(0,0,0), c(p0[1],p0[2],p0[3])) pt = from3d(pts, offset, maxz, minz) lines(pt, lty = 2) p0 = st_as_sfc(&quot;POINT(90 0)&quot;, crs = 4326) %&gt;% st_transform(&quot;+proj=geocent&quot;) p0 = p0[[1]] pts = rbind(c(0,0,0), c(p0[1],p0[2],p0[3])) pt = from3d(pts, offset, maxz, minz) lines(pt, lty = 2) f1 = rbind(cbind(0:60, 0)) arc = st_sfc(st_linestring(f1), crs=4326) geoc = st_transform(arc, &quot;+proj=geocent&quot;) cc = rbind(geoc[[1]]) circ = from3d(cc, offset, maxz, minz) lines(circ, col = &#39;red&#39;, lwd = 2, lty = 2) f1 = rbind(cbind(60, 0:47)) arc = st_sfc(st_linestring(f1), crs=4326) geoc = st_transform(arc, &quot;+proj=geocent&quot;) cc = rbind(geoc[[1]]) circ = from3d(cc, offset, maxz, minz) lines(circ, col = &#39;blue&#39;, lwd = 2, lty = 2) text(pt[1,1]+100000, pt[1,2]+50000, labels = expression(phi), col = &#39;blue&#39;) # lat text(pt[1,1]+20000, pt[1,2]-50000, labels = expression(lambda), col = &#39;red&#39;) # lng Figure 2.2: Cartesian geocentric coordinates (left) measure three distances, geographic coordinates (right) measure two angles \\(\\lambda\\) typically varies between \\(-180^{\\circ}\\) and \\(180^{\\circ}\\) (or alternatively from \\(0^{\\circ}\\) to \\(360^{\\circ}\\)), \\(\\phi\\) from \\(-90^{\\circ}\\) to \\(90^{\\circ}\\). When we are only interested in points on a sphere with given radius, we can drop \\(r\\): \\((\\lambda,\\phi)\\) now suffice to identify any point. It should be noted that this is just a definition, one could for instance also choose to measure polar angle, the angle between the vector and \\(z\\), instead of latitude. There is also a long tradition of specifying points as \\((\\phi,\\lambda)\\) but throughout this book we will stick to longitude-latitude, \\((\\lambda,\\phi)\\).

For points on an ellipse, there are two ways in which angle can be expressed (figure 2.3): measured from the center of the ellipse (\\(\\psi\\)), or measured perpendicular to the tangent on the ellipse at the target point (\\(\\phi\\)). par(mar = rep(0,4)) x = 4 y = 5/8 * sqrt(48) plot(x, y, xlim = c(-6,6), ylim = c(-8,8), asp = 1) axis(1, pos = 0, at = 0:9) axis(2, pos = 0, at = -5:5) xd = seq(-8, 8, by = .1) lines(xd, 5/8 * sqrt(64 - xd^2), col = &#39;grey&#39;) lines(xd, 5/8 * -sqrt(64 - xd^2), col = &#39;grey&#39;) arrows(0, 0, x, y, col = &#39;red&#39;, length = .15, angle = 20) b = (x * 25) / (-y * 64) a = y - x * b abline(a, b, col = &#39;grey&#39;) b = -1/b x0 = x - y / b arrows(x0, 0, x, y, col = &#39;blue&#39;, length = .15, angle = 20) text(1.2, 0.5, label = parse(text = &quot;psi&quot;), col = &#39;red&#39;) text(3, 0.5, label = parse(text = &quot;phi&quot;), col = &#39;blue&#39;) Figure 2.3: Angles on an ellipse: geographic (blue) and geocentric (red) latitude The most commonly used parametric model for the Earth is an ellipsoid of revolution, an ellipsoid with two equal semi-axes (Iliffe and Lott 2008). In effect, this is a flattened sphere (or spheroid): the distance between the poles is (slightly: about 0.33%) smaller than the distance between two opposite points on the equator. Under this model, longitude is always measured along a circle (as in figure 2.2), and latitude along an ellipse (as in figure 2.3). If we think of figure 2.3 as a cross section of the Earth passing through the poles, the geographic latitude measure \\(\\phi\\) is the one used when no further specification is given. The latitude measure \\(\\psi\\) is called the geocentric latitude. In addition to longitude and latitude we can add altitude or elevation to define points that are not on the spheroid, and obtain a three dimensional space again. When defining altitude, we need to choose where zero altitude is: on the ellipsoid, or relative to the surface approximating mean sea level (the geoid)? which direction is positive, and which direction is “straight up”: perpendicular to the spheroid surface, or in the direction perpendicular to the surface of the geoid? All these choices may matter, depending on the application area and required measurement accuracies. The shape of the Earth is not a perfect ellipsoid. As a consequence, several ellipsoids with different shape parameters and bound to the Earth in different ways are being used. Such ellipsoids are called datums, and are briefly discussed in section 8.1.4, along with coordinate reference systems. 2.3 Projected coordinates Because paper maps and computer screens are much more abundant and practical than globes, most of the time we look at spatial data we see it projected on a two-dimensional surface. Computing the locations on a two-dimensional space means that we work with projected coordinates. Projecting ellipsoidal coordinates means that shapes, directions, areas, or even all three, are distorted (Iliffe and Lott 2008). 2.4 Distances Distances between two points \\(p_i\\) and \\(p_j\\) in Cartesian coordinates are computed as Euclidian distances, in two dimensions by \\[d_{ij} = \\sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2}\\] with \\(p_i = (x_i,y_i)\\) and in three dimensions by \\[d_{ij} = \\sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2+(z_i-z_j)^2}\\] with \\(p_i = (x_i,y_i,z_i).\\) These distances represent the length of a straight line between two points \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). For two points on a circle, the length of the arc of two points \\(c_1 = (r,{\\phi}_i)\\) and \\(c_2 = (r, \\phi_2)\\) is \\[s_{ij}=r~|\\phi_1-\\phi_2| = r ~\\theta\\] with \\(\\theta\\) the angle between \\(\\phi_1\\) and \\(\\phi_2\\) in radians. For very small values of \\(\\theta\\), we will have \\(s_{ij} \\approx d_{ij}\\), because a small arc segment is nearly straight. For two points \\(p_1 = (\\lambda_1,\\phi_1)\\) and \\(p_2 = (\\lambda_2,\\phi_2)\\) on a sphere with radius \\(r&#39;\\), the great circle distance is the arc length between \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\) on the circle that passes through \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\) and has the center of the sphere as its center, and is given by \\(s_{12} = r ~ \\theta_{12}\\) with \\[\\theta_{12} = \\arccos(\\sin \\phi_1 \\cdot \\sin \\phi_2 + \\cos \\phi_1 \\cdot \\cos \\phi_2 \\cdot \\cos(|\\lambda_1-\\lambda_2|))\\] the angle between \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\), in radians. Arc distances between two points on a spheroid are more complicated to compute; a good discussion on the topic and an explanation of the method implemented in GeographicLib (part of PROJ) is given in Karney (2013). To show that these distance measures actually give different values, we computed them for the distance Berlin - Paris. Here, gc_ refers to ellipsoidal and spherical great circle distances, straight_ refers to straight line, Euclidean distances between Cartesian geocentric coordinates associated on the WGS84 ellipse and sphere: pts = st_sfc(st_point(c(13.4050, 52.5200)), st_point(c(2.3522, 48.8566)), crs = &#39;EPSG:4326&#39;) sf_use_s2(FALSE) d1 = c(gc_ellipse = st_distance(pts)[1,2]) sf_use_s2(TRUE) # or, without using s2, use st_distance(st_transform(pts, &quot;+proj=longlat +ellps=sphere&quot;)) d2 = c(gc_sphere = st_distance(pts)[1,2]) p = st_transform(pts, &quot;+proj=geocent&quot;) d3 = c(straight_ellipse = units::set_units(sqrt(sum(apply(do.call(cbind, p), 1, diff)^2)), m)) p2 = st_transform(pts, &quot;+proj=longlat +ellps=sphere&quot;) %&gt;% st_transform(&quot;+proj=geocent&quot;) d4 = c(straight_sphere = units::set_units(sqrt(sum(apply(do.call(cbind, p2), 1, diff)^2)), m)) res = c(d1,d3,d2,d4) # print as km, re-add names: res %&gt;% units::set_units(km) %&gt;% setNames(names(res)) # Units: [km] # gc_ellipse straight_ellipse gc_sphere straight_sphere # 880 879 877 877 2.5 Bounded and unbounded spaces Two-dimensinal and three-dimensional Euclidean spaces (\\(R^2\\) and \\(R^3\\)) are unbounded: every line in this space has infinite length, distances, areas or volumes are unbounded. In contrast, spaces defined on a circle (\\(S^1\\)) or sphere (\\(S^2\\)) define a bounded set: there may be infinitely many points but the length and area of the circle and the radius, area and volume of a sphere are bound. This may sound trivial, but leads to some interesting findings when handling spatial data. A polygon on \\(R^2\\) has unambiguously an inside and an outside. On a sphere, \\(S^2\\), any polygon divides the sphere in two parts, and which of these two is to be considered inside and which outside is ambiguous and needs to be defined e.g. by the traversal direction. 2.6 Time When we describe over which “space” a certain phenomenon is characterised, time forms an integral component: existing things do not exists forever or never. It is tempting to think that compared to geographical “space”, time is one-dimensional “linear”, and that is often the way we address time, e.g. in R where Date is represented by the number of days since 1970-01-01 (d = as.Date(&quot;1970-02-01&quot;)) # [1] &quot;1970-02-01&quot; as.numeric(d) # [1] 31 and POSIXt time by the number of seconds since the start of that date (t = as.POSIXct(&quot;1970-01-02 00:00&quot;, tz = &quot;UTC&quot;)) # [1] &quot;1970-01-02 UTC&quot; as.numeric(t) # [1] 86400 In practical cases however, we may be interested in how certain phenomena vary over the day, or over the year, in which case it may be more convenient to represent time as the tuple (year, day-of-year), or (day, time-of-day), where day-of-year or time-of-day have a cyclic nature, like angles. When we study for instance traffic patterns, day of week plays a role, in which we may end up with (year, week-of-year, day-of-week, time-of-day) in order to quantify hourly, daily, weekly, and yearly signals. This decomposes time essentially multiple components, with typically some of them being cyclic. 2.7 Exercises convert the \\((x,y)\\) points \\((10,2)\\), \\((-10,-2)\\), \\((10,-2)\\) and \\((0,10)\\) to polar coordinates convert the polar \\((r,\\phi)\\) points \\((10,45^{\\circ})\\), \\((0,100^{\\circ})\\) and \\((5,359^{\\circ})\\) to Cartesian coordinates assuming the Earth is a sphere with a radius of 6371 km, compute for \\((\\lambda,\\phi)\\) points the great circle distance between \\((10,10)\\) and \\((11,10)\\), between \\((10,80)\\) and \\((11,80)\\), between \\((10,10)\\) and \\((10,11)\\) and between \\((10,80)\\) and \\((10,81)\\) (units: degree). What are the distance units?

By features we mean things that have a geometry, potentially some time properties, and other attributes that could include a label describing the thing and quantitative measures of it. The main application of simple feature geometries is to describe two-dimensional geometries by points, lines, or polygons. The “simple” adjective refers to the fact that the line or polygon geometries are represented by sequences of points connected with straight lines that do not self-intersect. Simple features access is a standard (Herring 2011, @sfa2, @iso) for describing simple feature geometries that includes a class hierarchy a set of operations binary and text encodings We will first discuss the seven most common simple feature geometry types. 3.1.1 The big seven The most commonly used simple features geometries, used to represent a single feature are: type description POINT single point geometry MULTIPOINT set of points LINESTRING single linestring (two or more points connected by straight lines) MULTILINESTRING set of linestrings POLYGON exterior ring with zero or more inner rings, denoting holes MULTIPOLYGON set of polygons GEOMETRYCOLLECTION set of the geometries above library(sf) par(mfrow = c(2,4)) par(mar = c(1,1,1.2,1)) # 1 p = st_point(0:1) plot(p, pch = 16) title(&quot;point&quot;) box(col = &#39;grey&#39;) # 2 mp = st_multipoint(rbind(c(1,1), c(2, 2), c(4, 1), c(2, 3), c(1,4))) plot(mp, pch = 16) title(&quot;multipoint&quot;) box(col = &#39;grey&#39;) # 3 ls = st_linestring(rbind(c(1,1), c(5,5), c(5, 6), c(4, 6), c(3, 4), c(2, 3))) plot(ls, lwd = 2) title(&quot;linestring&quot;) box(col = &#39;grey&#39;) # 4 mls = st_multilinestring(list( rbind(c(1,1), c(5,5), c(5, 6), c(4, 6), c(3, 4), c(2, 3)), rbind(c(3,0), c(4,1), c(2,1)))) plot(mls, lwd = 2) title(&quot;multilinestring&quot;) box(col = &#39;grey&#39;) # 5 polygon po = st_polygon(list(rbind(c(2,1), c(3,1), c(5,2), c(6,3), c(5,3), c(4,4), c(3,4), c(1,3), c(2,1)), rbind(c(2,2), c(3,3), c(4,3), c(4,2), c(2,2)))) plot(po, border = &#39;black&#39;, col = &#39;#ff8888&#39;, lwd = 2) title(&quot;polygon&quot;) box(col = &#39;grey&#39;) # 6 multipolygon mpo = st_multipolygon(list( list(rbind(c(2,1), c(3,1), c(5,2), c(6,3), c(5,3), c(4,4), c(3,4), c(1,3), c(2,1)), rbind(c(2,2), c(3,3), c(4,3), c(4,2), c(2,2))), list(rbind(c(3,7), c(4,7), c(5,8), c(3,9), c(2,8), c(3,7))))) mpo # MULTIPOLYGON (((2 1, 3 1, 5 2, 6 3, 5 3, 4 4, 3 4, 1 3, 2 1), (2 2, 3 3, 4 3, 4 2, 2 2)), ((3 7, 4 7, 5 8, 3 9, 2 8, 3 7))) plot(mpo, border = &#39;black&#39;, col = &#39;#ff8888&#39;, lwd = 2) title(&quot;multipolygon&quot;) box(col = &#39;grey&#39;) # 7 geometrycollection gc = st_geometrycollection(list(po, ls + c(0,5), st_point(c(2,5)), st_point(c(5,4)))) plot(gc, border = &#39;black&#39;, col = &#39;#ff6666&#39;, pch = 16, lwd = 2) title(&quot;geometrycollection&quot;) box(col = &#39;grey&#39;) Figure 3.1: sketches of the main simple feature geometry types Figure 3.1 shows examples of these basic geometry types. The human-readable, “well-known-text” (WKT) representation of the geometries plotted are: p # POINT (0 1) mp # MULTIPOINT ((1 1), (2 2), (4 1), (2 3), (1 4)) ls # LINESTRING (1 1, 5 5, 5 6, 4 6, 3 4, 2 3) mls # MULTILINESTRING ((1 1, 5 5, 5 6, 4 6, 3 4, 2 3), (3 0, 4 1, 2 1)) po # POLYGON ((2 1, 3 1, 5 2, 6 3, 5 3, 4 4, 3 4, 1 3, 2 1), (2 2, 3 3, 4 3, 4 2, 2 2)) mpo # MULTIPOLYGON (((2 1, 3 1, 5 2, 6 3, 5 3, 4 4, 3 4, 1 3, 2 1), (2 2, 3 3, 4 3, 4 2, 2 2)), ((3 7, 4 7, 5 8, 3 9, 2 8, 3 7))) gc # GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (POLYGON ((2 1, 3 1, 5 2, 6 3, 5 3, 4 4, 3 4, 1 3, 2 1), (2 2, 3 3, 4 3, 4 2, 2 2)), LINESTRING (1 6, 5 10, 5 11, 4 11, 3 9, 2 8), POINT (2 5), POINT (5 4)) In this representation, coordinates are separated by space, and points by commas. Sets are denoted by parentheses, and separated by commas. Individual points in a geometry contain at least two coordinates: x and y, in that order. If these coordinates refer to geographic coordinates, x and y usually refer to longitude and latitude, respectively, although sometimes to latitude and longitude (see section (???)(axisorder)). 3.1.2 Simple and valid geometries, ring direction Linestrings are called simple when they do not self-intersect: (ls = st_linestring(rbind(c(0,0), c(1,1), c(2,2), c(0,2), c(1,1), c(2,0)))) # LINESTRING (0 0, 1 1, 2 2, 0 2, 1 1, 2 0) c(is_simple = st_is_simple(ls)) # is_simple # FALSE Valid polygons and multipolygons obey the following properties: polygon rings are closed (the last point equals the first) polygon holes (inner rings) are inside their exterior ring polygon inner rings maximally touch the exterior ring in single points, not over a line a polygon ring shall not repeat its own path in a multipolygon, an external ring maximally touches another exterior ring in single points, not over a line If this is not the case, the geometry concerned is not valid. A further convention is that the outer ring of a polygon is winded counter-clockwise, while the holes are winded clockwise, but polygons for which this is not the case are still considered valid. For polygons on the sphere, the “clockwise” concept does not work well: if we take the equator as polygon, is the Northern hemisphere or the Southern hemisphere “inside”? The convention taken here is to consider the area on the left while traversing the polygon is considered the polygon’s inside. 3.1.3 Z and M coordinates In addition to X and Y coordinates, Single points (vertices) of simple feature geometries may have a Z coordinate, denoting altitude, and/or an M value, denoting some “measure” The M attribute shall be a property of the vertex. It sounds attractive to encode a time stamp in it, e.g. to pack trajectories in LINESTRINGs. These become however invalid (or “non-simple”) once the trajectory self-intersects, as only X and Y are considered for self-intersections. Both Z and M are not found often, and software support to do something useful with them is (still) rare. Their WKT representation are fairly easily understood: st_point(c(1,3,2)) # POINT Z (1 3 2) st_point(c(1,3,2), dim = &quot;XYM&quot;) # POINT M (1 3 2) st_linestring(rbind(c(3,1,2,4), c(4,4,2,2))) # LINESTRING ZM (3 1 2 4, 4 4 2 2) 3.1.4 Empty geometries A very important concept in the feature geometry framework is that of the empty geometry. Empty geometries arise naturally when we do geometrical operations (section 3.2), for instance when we want to know the intersection of POINT (0 0) and POINT (1 1): (e = st_intersection(st_point(c(0,0)), st_point(c(1,1)))) # GEOMETRYCOLLECTION EMPTY and it represents essentially the empty set: when combining (unioning) an empty point it with other non-empty geometries, it vanishes. All geometry types have a special value representing the empty (typed) geometry: st_point() # POINT EMPTY st_linestring(matrix(1,1,3)[0,], dim = &quot;XYM&quot;) # LINESTRING M EMPTY but it seems that they all point to the same empty set. 3.1.5 Ten further geometry types There are 10 more geometry types which are more rare, but increasingly find implementation: type description CIRCULARSTRING The CIRCULARSTRING is the basic curve type, similar to a LINESTRING in the linear world. A single segment requires three points, the start and end points (first and third) and any other point on the arc. The exception to this is for a closed circle, where the start and end points are the same. In this case the second point MUST be the center of the arc, ie the opposite side of the circle. To chain arcs together, the last point of the previous arc becomes the first point of the next arc, just like in LINESTRING. This means that a valid circular string must have an odd number of points greated than 1. COMPOUNDCURVE A compound curve is a single, continuous curve that has both curved (circular) segments and linear segments. That means that in addition to having well-formed components, the end point of every component (except the last) must be coincident with the start point of the following component. CURVEPOLYGON Example compound curve in a curve polygon: CURVEPOLYGON(COMPOUNDCURVE(CIRCULARSTRING(0 0,2 0, 2 1, 2 3, 4 3),(4 3, 4 5, 1 4, 0 0)), CIRCULARSTRING(1.7 1, 1.4 0.4, 1.6 0.4, 1.6 0.5, 1.7 1) ) MULTICURVE A MultiCurve is a 1-dimensional GeometryCollection whose elements are Curves, it can include linear strings, circular strings or compound strings. MULTISURFACE A MultiSurface is a 2-dimensional GeometryCollection whose elements are Surfaces, all using coordinates from the same coordinate reference system. CURVE A Curve is a 1-dimensional geometric object usually stored as a sequence of Points, with the subtype of Curve specifying the form of the interpolation between Points SURFACE A Surface is a 2-dimensional geometric object POLYHEDRALSURFACE A PolyhedralSurface is a contiguous collection of polygons, which share common boundary segments TIN A TIN (triangulated irregular network) is a PolyhedralSurface consisting only of Triangle patches. TRIANGLE A Triangle is a polygon with 3 distinct, non-collinear vertices and no interior boundary CIRCULASTRING, COMPOUNDCURVE and CURVEPOLYGON are not described in the SFA standard, but in the SQL-MM part 3 standard. The descriptions above were copied from the PostGIS manual. 3.1.6 Text and binary encodings Part of the simple feature standard are two encodings: a text and a binary encoding. The well-known text encoding, used above, is human-readable, the well-known binary encoding is machine-readable. Binary encodings are lossless and typically faster than text encoding (and parsing), and are used for instance in all communications between R package sf and the GDAL, GEOS, liblwgeom and s2geometry libraries. 3.2 Operations on geometries Simple feature geometries can be queried for properties, transformed into new geometries, and combinations of geometries can be queried for properties. This section gives an overview of the operations entirely focusing on geometrical properties. Chapter, 5, focuses on the analysis of non-geometrical feature properties, in relationship to their geometries. Some of the material in this section appeared in (Pebesma 2018). We can categorise operations on geometries in terms of what they take as input, and what they return as output. In terms of output we have operations that return predicates: a logical asserting a certain property is TRUE, measures: a value (e.g. a numeric value with measurement unit), or transformations: newly generated geometries and in terms of what they operate on, we distinguish operations that are unary when they work on a single geometry binary when they work on pairs of geometries n-ary when they work on sets of geometries 3.2.1 Unary predicates Unary predicates describe a certain property of a geometry. The predicates is_simple, is_valid, and is_empty returns respectively whether a geometry is simple, valid or empty. Given a coordinate reference system, is_longlat returns whether the coordinates are geographic or projected. is(geometry, class) checks whether a geometry belongs to a particular class. 3.2.2 Binary predicates and DE-9IM The Dimensionally Extended nine-Intersection Model (DE-9IM, (Clementini, Di Felice, and Oosterom 1993; Egenhofer and Franzosa 1991)) is a model that helps describing the qualitative relation between any two geometries in two-dimensional space (\\(R^2\\)). Any geometry has a dimension value that is 0 for points, 1 for linear geometries, 2 for polygonal geometries, and F (false) for empty geometries. Any geometry also has an inside (I), a boundary (B) and an exterior (E); these roles are obvious for polygons but e.g. for lines the boundary is formed by the end points, and the interior by all non-end points on the line, points have a zero-dimensional inside but no boundary library(sf) polygon = po = st_polygon(list(rbind(c(0,0), c(1,0), c(1,1), c(0,1), c(0,0)))) p0 = st_polygon(list(rbind(c(-1,-1), c(2,-1), c(2,2), c(-1,2), c(-1,-1)))) line = li = st_linestring(rbind(c(.5, -.5), c(.5, 0.5))) s = st_sfc(po, li) par(mfrow = c(3,3)) par(mar = c(1,1,1,1)) # &quot;1020F1102&quot; # 1: 1 plot(s, col = c(NA, &#39;darkgreen&#39;), border = &#39;blue&#39;, main = expression(paste(&quot;I(pol)&quot;,intersect(),&quot;I(line) = 1&quot;))) lines(rbind(c(.5,0), c(.5,.495)), col = &#39;red&#39;, lwd = 2) points(0.5, 0.5, pch = 1) # 2: 0 plot(s, col = c(NA, &#39;darkgreen&#39;), border = &#39;blue&#39;, main = expression(paste(&quot;I(pol)&quot;,intersect(),&quot;B(line) = 0&quot;))) points(0.5, 0.5, col = &#39;red&#39;, pch = 16) # 3: 2 plot(s, col = c(NA, &#39;darkgreen&#39;), border = &#39;blue&#39;, main = expression(paste(&quot;I(pol)&quot;,intersect(),&quot;E(line) = 2&quot;))) plot(po, col = &#39;#ff8888&#39;, add = TRUE) plot(s, col = c(NA, &#39;darkgreen&#39;), border = &#39;blue&#39;, add = TRUE) # 4: 0 plot(s, col = c(NA, &#39;darkgreen&#39;), border = &#39;blue&#39;, main = expression(paste(&quot;B(pol)&quot;,intersect(),&quot;I(line) = 0&quot;))) points(.5, 0, col = &#39;red&#39;, pch = 16) # 5: F plot(s, col = c(NA, &#39;darkgreen&#39;), border = &#39;blue&#39;, main = expression(paste(&quot;B(pol)&quot;,intersect(),&quot;B(line) = F&quot;))) # 6: 1 plot(s, col = c(NA, &#39;darkgreen&#39;), border = &#39;blue&#39;, main = expression(paste(&quot;B(pol)&quot;,intersect(),&quot;E(line) = 1&quot;))) plot(po, border = &#39;red&#39;, col = NA, add = TRUE, lwd = 2) # 7: 1 plot(s, col = c(NA, &#39;darkgreen&#39;), border = &#39;blue&#39;, main = expression(paste(&quot;E(pol)&quot;,intersect(),&quot;I(line) = 1&quot;))) lines(rbind(c(.5, -.5), c(.5, 0)), col = &#39;red&#39;, lwd = 2) # 8: 0 plot(s, col = c(NA, &#39;darkgreen&#39;), border = &#39;blue&#39;, main = expression(paste(&quot;E(pol)&quot;,intersect(),&quot;B(line) = 0&quot;))) points(.5, -.5, col = &#39;red&#39;, pch = 16) # 9: 2 plot(s, col = c(NA, &#39;darkgreen&#39;), border = &#39;blue&#39;, main = expression(paste(&quot;E(pol)&quot;,intersect(),&quot;E(line) = 2&quot;))) plot(p0 / po, col = &#39;#ff8888&#39;, add = TRUE) plot(s, col = c(NA, &#39;darkgreen&#39;), border = &#39;blue&#39;, add = TRUE) Figure 3.2: DE-9IM: intersections between the interior, boundary and exterior of a polygon (rows) and of a linestring (columns) indicated by red Figure 3.2 shows the intersections between the I, B and E components of a polygon and a linestring indicated by red; the sub-plot title gives the dimension of these intersections (0, 1, 2 or F). The relationship between the two geometries is the concatenation of these dimensions: st_relate(polygon, line) # [,1] # [1,] &quot;1020F1102&quot; Using the ability to express relationships, we can also query pairs of geometries about particular conditions expressed in a mask string; e.g. the string \"*0*******\" would evaluate TRUE when the second geometry has one or more boundary points in common with the interior of the first geometry; the symbol * standing for “any dimensionality” (0, 1, 2 or F). The mask string \"T********\" matches pairs of geometry with intersecting interiors. Here, the symbol T stands for any intersection (of dimensionality 0, 1 or 2). Binary predicates are further described using normal-language verbs, using DE-9IM definitions. For instance, the predicate equals corresponds to the relationship \"T*F**FFF*\". If any two geometries obey this relationship, they are (topologically) equal, but may have a different ordering of nodes. A list of binary predicates is predicate meaning inverse of equals Two geometries A and B are topologically identical contains None of the points of A are outside B within contains_properly A contains B and B has no points in common with the boundary of A covers No points of B lie in the exterior of A covered_by covered_by inverse of covers crosses A and B have some but not all interior points in common disjoint A and B have no points in common intersects equals A and B are geometrically equal; node order number of nodes may differ; identical to A contains B AND A within B equals_exact A and B are geometrically equal, and have identical node order intersects A and B are not disjoint disjoint is_within_distance A is closer to B than a given distance within None of the points of B are outside A contains touches A and B have at least one boundary point in common, but no interior points overlaps A and B have some points in common; the dimension of these is identical to that of A and B relate given a mask pattern, returns whether A and B adhere to this pattern The Wikipedia DE-9IM page provides the relate patterns for each of these verbs. They are important to check out; for instance covers and contains (and their inverses) are often not completely intuitive: if A contains B, B has no points in common with the exterior or boundary of A if A covers B, B has no points in common with the exterior of A 3.2.3 Unary Measures Unary measures return a single value that describes a property of the geometry: measure returns dimension 0 for points, 1 for linear, 2 for polygons, NA for empty geometries area the area of a geometry length the length of a linear geometry geohash the geohash for a geometry geometry_type the type of a geometries 3.2.4 Binary Measures distance returns the distances between pairs of geometries. relate (without mask) returns the relation pattern, a qualitative description of the geometrical relationship between two geometries explained in section 3.2.2. 3.2.5 Unary Transformers Unary transformations work on a per-geometry basis, and for each geometry return a new geometry. transformer returns a geometry … centroid of type POINT with the geometry’s centroid buffer that is this larger (or smaller) than the input geometry, depending on the buffer size jitter that was moved in space a certain amount, using a bivariate uniform distribution wrap_dateline cut into pieces that do no longer cover the dateline boundary with the boundary of the input geometry convex_hull that forms the convex hull of the input geometry (figure 3.3) line_merge after merging connecting LINESTRING elements of a MULTILINESTRING into longer LINESTRINGs. make_valid that is valid node with added nodes to linear geometries at intersections without a node; only works on individual linear geometries point_on_surface with a (arbitrary) point on a surface polygonize of type polygon, created from lines that form a closed ring segmentize a (linear) geometry with nodes at a given density or minimal distance simplify simplified by removing vertices/nodes (lines or polygons) split that has been split with a splitting linestring transform transformed to a new coordinate reference system (chapter 8) triangulate with triangulated polygon(s) voronoi with the voronoi tesselation of an input geometry (figure 3.3) zm with removed or added Z and/or M coordinates collection_extract with subgeometries from a GEOMETRYCOLLECTION of a particular type cast that is converted to another type + that is shifted over a given vector * that is multiplied by a scalar or matrix par(mar = rep(0,4), mfrow = c(1, 2)) plot(st_geometry(nc)[1], col = NA, border = &#39;black&#39;) plot(st_convex_hull(st_geometry(nc)[1]), add = TRUE, col = NA, border = &#39;red&#39;) box() set.seed(131) mp = st_multipoint(matrix(runif(20), 10)) plot(mp) plot(st_voronoi(mp), add = TRUE, col = NA, border = &#39;red&#39;) box() Figure 3.3: left: convex hull (red) around a polygon (black); right: voronoi diagram (red) from a MULTIPOINT (black) 3.2.6 Binary Transformers Binary functions that return a geometry include function returns infix operator intersection the overlapping geometries for pair of geometries &amp; union the combination of the geometries; removes internal boundaries and duplicate points, nodes or line pieces | difference the geometries of the first after removing the overlap with the second geometry / sym_differenec the combinations of the geometries after removing where they overlap %/% 3.2.7 N-ary transformers N-ary operate on sets of geometries. union can be applied to a set of geometries to return its geometrical union. Otherwise, any set of geometries can be combined into a MULTI-type geometry when they have equal dimension, or else into a GEOMETRYCOLLECTION. Without unioning, this may lead to a geometry that is not valid, e.g. because two polygon rings have a boundary line in common. N-ary intersection and difference take a single argument, but operate (sequentially) on all pairs, triples, quadruples etc. Consider the plot in figure 3.4: how do we identify the area where all three boxes overlap? Using binary intersections gives us intersections for all pairs: 1-1, 1-1, 1-3, 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 3-1, 3-2, 3-3, but does not let us identify areas where more than two geometries intersect. Figure @(fig:boxes) (right) shows the n-ary intersection: the 7 unique, non-overlapping geometries originating from intersection of one, two, or more geometries. par(mar = rep(.1, 4), mfrow = c(1, 2)) sq = function(pt, sz = 1) st_polygon(list(rbind(c(pt - sz), c(pt[1] + sz, pt[2] - sz), c(pt + sz), c(pt[1] - sz, pt[2] + sz), c(pt - sz)))) x = st_sf(box = 1:3, st_sfc(sq(c(0,0)), sq(c(1.7, -0.5)), sq(c(0.5, 1)))) plot(st_geometry(x), col = NA, border = sf.colors(3, categorical=TRUE), lwd = 3) plot(st_intersection(st_geometry(x)), col = sf.colors(7, categorical=TRUE, alpha = .5)) Figure 3.4: left: three overlapping boxes – how do we identify the small box where all three overlap? right: unique, non-overlapping n-ary intersections Similarly, one can compute an n-ary difference from a set \\(\\{s_1, s_2, s_3, ...\\}\\) by creating differences \\(\\{s_1, s_2-s_1, s_3-s_2-s_1, ...\\}\\). This is shown in figure 3.5, left for the original set, right for the set after reversing its order to make clear that the result here depends on the ordering of the input geometries. Again, resulting geometries do not overlap. par(mar = rep(.1, 4), mfrow = c(1, 2)) xg = st_geometry(x) plot(st_difference(xg), col = sf.colors(3, alpha = .5, categorical=TRUE)) plot(st_difference(xg[3:1]), col = sf.colors(3, alpha = .5, categorical=TRUE)) Figure 3.5: difference between subsequent boxes, left: in original order; right: in reverse order 3.3 Precision Geometrical operations, such as finding out whether a certain point is on a line, may fail when coordinates are represented by double precision floating point numbers, such as 8-byte doubles used in R. An often chosen remedy is to limit the precision of the coordinates before the operation. For this, a precision model is adopted; the most common is to choose a factor \\(p\\) and compute rounded coordinates \\(c&#39;\\) from original coordinates \\(c\\) by \\[c&#39; = \\mbox{round}(p \\cdot c) / p\\] Rounding of this kind brings the coordinates to points on a regular grid with spacing \\(1/p\\), which is beneficial for geometric computations. Of course, it also affects all computations like areas and distances, and may turn valid geometries into invalid ones. Which precision values are best for which application is often a matter of common sense combined with trial and error. A reproducible example illustrating the need for setting precision is found here. 3.4 Coverages: tesselations and rasters (FIXME: discuss DE9-IM and uniquely assigning all points!! “Spatial predicates are topologically-invariant binary spatial relations based on the DE-9IM” invariant under homeomorphisms. Projections are, in general, no homeomorphisms. (mappings that preserve all the topological properties of a given space) ) OGC (Baumann, Hirschorn, and Masó 2017) defines a coverage as a ``feature that acts as a function to return values from its range for any direct position within its spatiotemporal domain’’. Having a function implies that for every spatiotemporal “point” (spatial point and moment in time) of the domain we have single value for the range. This is a very common situation for many spatiotemporal phenomena, a few examples can be given: boundary disputes aside, every point in a region (domain) belongs to a single adminstrative unit (range) at any given moment in time, every point in a region (domain) has a certain land cover type (range) every point in an area (domain) has a single elevation (range), e.g. measured with respect to a given mean sea level surface every spatiotemporal point in a threedimensional body of air (domain) has single value for temperature (range) (A caveat here is that because measurement always takes time and requires space, measured values are always an average over a spatiotemporal volume, and hence range variables can rarely be measured for true, zero-volume “points”; for many practical cases however the measured volume is small enough to be considered a “point”; for a variable like land cover type the volume needs to be chosen such that the types distinguished make sense with respect to the measured units). In the first two of the given examples the range variable is categorical, in the last two the range variable is continuous. For categorical range variables, if large connected areas have a constant range value, an efficient way to represent these data is by storing the boundaries of the areas with constant value, such as country boundaries. Although this can be done by a set of simple feature geometries (polygons or multipolygons), it is hard to guarantee for such a set of simple feature polygons that they do not overlap, or that there are no gaps between them. 3.4.1 Topological models A data model that guarantees no inadvertent gaps or overlaps of polygonal coverages is the topological model, examples of which are found in geographic information systems (GIS) like GRASS GIS or ArcGIS. Topological models store boundaries between polygons only once, and register which polygonal area is on either side of a boundary. Deriving the set of (multi)polygons for each area with a constant range value from a topological model is straightforward; the other way around: deriving topology from a set of polygons involves setting thresholds and handling gaps and overlaps. 3.4.2 Raster tesselations A tesselation is a subdivision of a space (area, volume) into smaller elements by ways of polygons. A regular tesselation does this with regular polygons: triangles, squares or hexagons. Tesselations using squares are very commonly used for spatial data, and are called raster data. Raster data tesselate each spatial dimension \\(d\\) into regular cells, formed e.g. by left-closed and right-open intervals \\(d_i\\): \\[\\begin{equation} d_i = d_0 + [~ i \\cdot \\delta, (i+1) \\cdot \\delta~) \\end{equation}\\] with \\(d_0\\) an offset, \\(\\delta\\) the interval (cell or pixel) size, and where the cell index \\(i\\) is an arbitrary but consecutive set of integers. The \\(\\delta\\) value is often taken negative for the \\(y\\)-axis (Northing), indicating that raster row numbers increasing Southwards correspond to \\(y\\)-coordinates increasing Northwards. In arbitrary polygon tesselations, assigning points to polygons when they fall on a boundary shared by two polygons is ambiguous. Using left-closed “[” and right-open “)” intervals in regular tesselations removes this ambiguity. Tesselating the time dimension with left-closed, right-open intervals is very common, and reflects the implicit assumption underlying time series packages such as xts in R, where time stamps indicate the start of time intervals. Different models can be combined: one could use simple feature polygons to tesselate space, and combine this with a regular tesselation of time in order to cover a space-time vector datacube. Raster data and data cubes are discussed in chapter 6. 3.5 Networks Spatial networks are typically composed of linear (LINESTRING) elements, but possess further topological properties describing the network coherence: start and endpoints of a linestring may be connected to other linestring start or end points, forming a set of nodes and edges edges may be directed, and allow for connections (flow, transport) in only one way. Several R packages (osmar, stplanr, sfnetworks) have functionality available for constructing network objects, and working with them, e.g. computing shortest or fastest routes through a network. References "],["spherical.html", "Chapter 4 Spherical Geometries 4.1 Straight lines 4.2 Ring direction 4.3 Full polygon 4.4 Bounding box, rectangle, and cap 4.5 Validity on the sphere", " Chapter 4 Spherical Geometries The previous chapter discussed geometries defined on the plane, \\(R^2\\). This chapter discusses what changes when we consider geometries not on the plane, but on the sphere (\\(S^2\\)). Although we learned in chapter 2 that the shape of the Earth is usually approximated by an ellipsoid, none of the libraries shown in green in figure 1.6 provide access to a comprehensive set of functions using ellipsoidal geometries, whereas the s2geometry (Dunnington, Pebesma, and Rubak 2020; Veach et al. 2020) library does provide it using a sphere rather than an ellipsoid. When compared to a flat (projected) space assumed in the previous chapter, a sphere is a much better approximation to an ellipsoid. 4.1 Straight lines The basic premise of simple features of chapter @{geometries} is that geometries are represented by sequences of points connected by straight lines. On \\(R^2\\) (or any Cartesian space), this is is trivial, but on a sphere straightlines do not exist. The shortest line connecting two points is an arc of the circle through both points and the center of the sphere, also called a great circle segment. A consequence is that “the” shortest distance line connecting two points on opposing sides of the sphere does not exist, as any great circle segment connecting them has equal length. 4.2 Ring direction Any polygon on the sphere divides the sphere surface in two parts with finite area: the inside and the outside. Using the “counter clockwise rule” as was done for \\(R^2\\) will not work, because the direction interpretation depends on what is defined as inside. A way out is to define the inside as the left (or right) side of the polygon boundary when traversing its points in sequence. Reversal of the node order then switches inside and outside. 4.3 Full polygon In addition to empty polygons, on a sphere one can define the full polygon, which comprises its entire surface. This is useful, for instance for computing the oceans as the geometric difference between the full polygon and those of the land mass. 4.4 Bounding box, rectangle, and cap Where in \\(R^2\\) one can easily define bounding boxes as the range of the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates, for geographic coordinates these ranges are not of much use when geometries cross the antimeridian (longitude +/- 180) or one of the poles. The assumption in \\(R^2\\) that lower \\(x\\) values are Westwards of higher ones does not hold when crossing the antimeridian. An alternative to delineating an area on a sphere that is more natural is the bounding cap, defined by its center coordinates and a radius. For Antarctica, as depicted in figure 4.1 (a) and (c), the bounding box formed by coordinate ranges is library(sf) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(maps)) # maps: par(mfrow = c(2,2)) par(mar = c(1,1.2,1,1)) m = st_as_sf(map(fill=TRUE, plot=FALSE)) a = m[m$ID == &quot;Antarctica&quot;, ] st_bbox(a) # xmin ymin xmax ymax # -180.0 -85.2 179.6 -60.5 which clearly does not contain the region (ymin being -90 and xmax 180). Two geometries that do contain the region are the bounding cap: library(s2) s2_bounds_cap(a) # lng lat angle # 1 0 -90 29.5 and the bounding rectangle: s2_bounds_rect(a) # lng_lo lat_lo lng_hi lat_hi # 1 -180 -90 180 -60.5 For an area spanning the antimeridian, here the Fiji island country, the bounding box st_bbox(m[m$ID == &quot;Fiji&quot;,]) # xmin ymin xmax ymax # -179.9 -21.7 180.2 -12.5 seems to span most of the Earth, as opposed to the bounding rectangle s2_bounds_rect(m[m$ID == &quot;Fiji&quot;,]) # lng_lo lat_lo lng_hi lat_hi # 1 175 -21.7 -178 -12.5 where a value lng_lo larger than lng_hi indicates that the bounding rectangle spans the antimeridian. This property could not be infered from the coordinate ranges (bounding box) themselves. 4.5 Validity on the sphere Many global datasets are given in geographic coordinates but are prepared in a way that they “work” when interpreted on the \\(R^2\\) space [-180,180] \\(\\times\\) [-90,90]. This means that geometries crossing the antimeridian (longitude +/- 180) are cut in halves, such that they no longer cross it (but nearly touch eachother) geometries including a pole, like Antarctica, are cut at +/- 180 and make an excursion through -180,-90 and 180,90 (both representing the Geographic South Pole). Figure 4.1 shows two different representation of Antarctica, plotted with geographical coordinates taken as \\(R^2\\) (top) and in a Polar Stereographic projection (bottom), without (left) and with (right) en excursion through the Geographic South Pole. In the projections as plotted, polygons polygons (b) and (c) are valid; polygon (a) is not valid as it self-intersects, polygon (d) is not valid because it traverses the same edge to the South Pole twice. On the sphere (\\(S^2\\)), polygon (a) is valid but (b) is not, for the same reason as (d) is not valid. library(sf) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(maps)) # maps: par(mfrow = c(2,2)) par(mar = c(1,1.2,1,1)) m = st_as_sf(map(fill=TRUE, plot=FALSE)) m = m[m$ID == &quot;Antarctica&quot;, ] plot(st_geometry(m), asp = 2) title(&quot;a (not valid)&quot;) # ne: library(rnaturalearth) ne = ne_countries(returnclass = &quot;sf&quot;) ne = ne[ne$region_un == &quot;Antarctica&quot;, &quot;region_un&quot;] plot(st_geometry(ne), asp = 2) title(&quot;b (valid)&quot;) # 3031 m %&gt;% st_geometry() %&gt;% st_transform(3031) %&gt;% plot() title(&quot;c (valid)&quot;) ne %&gt;% st_geometry() %&gt;% st_transform(3031) %&gt;% plot() title(&quot;d (not valid)&quot;) Figure 4.1: different representations of Antarctica, (a, c): with a polygon not passing through (-180 -90); (b, d): with a polygon passing through (-180 -90) and (180 -90) References "],["featureattributes.html", "Chapter 5 Attributes, Up- and Downscaling 5.1 Attribute-geometry relationships 5.2 Spatial join 5.3 Aggregating and Summarising 5.4 Area-weighted interpolation 5.5 Exercises", " Chapter 5 Attributes, Up- and Downscaling Feature attributes refer to the properties of features (“things”) that do not describe the feature’s geometry. Feature attributes can be derived from geometry (e.g. length of a LINESTRING, area of a POLYGON) but they can also refer to completely different properties, such as the name of a street or a county, the number of people living in a country, the type of a road the soil type in a polygon from a soil map. the opening hours of a shop the body weight or heart beat of an animal the NO\\(_2\\) concentration measured at an air quality monitoring station Although temporal properties of features are no less fundamental than their spatial properties, the simple feature access standard does not give time a similar role as space; more on that in chapter 6. Spatial data science software implementing simple features typically organizes data in tables that contain both geometries and attributes for features; this is true for geopandas in Python, PostGIS tables in PostgreSQL, and sf objects in R. The geometric operations described in the previous chapter (3.2) operate on geometries only, and may occasionally yield attributes (predicates or measures), but will not modify attributes present. In all these cases, while manipulating geometries, attribute values remain unmodified. At first sight, that looks rather harmless. But if we look into a simple case of replacing a county boundary with a county centroid, we may see a warning is emitted: library(sf) library(dplyr) system.file(&quot;gpkg/nc.gpkg&quot;, package=&quot;sf&quot;) %&gt;% read_sf() %&gt;% st_transform(32119) %&gt;% select(BIR74, SID74, NAME) %&gt;% st_centroid() %&gt;% head(n = 1) -&gt; x # save as x # Warning in st_centroid.sf(.): st_centroid assumes attributes are constant over # geometries of x st_geometry(x)[[1]] # POINT (385605 3e+05) This warning is justified for the first two variables shown (total births and number of SID disease cases, 1974) which, as such, are not associated with a feature whose geometry is POINT (385605.4 300303.5). The third variable, NAME is however still the county name for the point indicated, but the point geometry no longer is the county geometry. In section 1.6 we already described that for non-point geometries, feature attribute values may either have point support, meaning that the value applies to every point, or they may have block support, meaning that the value summarizes all points in the geometry. More complex options, e.g. inbetween these two extremes, may also occur. This chapter will describe different ways in which an attribute may relate to the geometry, its consequences on analysing such data, and ways to derive attribute data for different geometries (up- and downscaling). 5.1 Attribute-geometry relationships Changing the feature geometry without changing the feature attributes does change the feature, since the feature is characterised by the combination of geometry and attributes. Can we, ahead of time, predict whether the resulting feature will still meaningfully relate to the attribute data when we replace all geometries for instance with their convex hull or centroid? It depends. Take the example of a road, represented by a LINESTRING, which has an attribute property road width equal to 10 m. What can we say about the road width of an arbitray subsectin of this road? That depends on whether the attribute road length describes, for instance the road width everywhere, meaning that road width is constant along the road, or whether it describes an aggregate property, such as minimum or average road width. In case of the minimum, for an arbitrary subsection of the road one could still argue that the minimum road width must be at least as large as the minimum road width for the whole segment, but it may no longer be the minimum for that subsection. This gives us two “types” for the attribute-geometry relationship (AGR): constant the attribute value is valid everywhere in or over the geometry aggregate the attribute is an aggregate, a summary value over the geometry For polygon data, typical examples of constant AGR are land use for a land use polygon rock units or geologic strata in a geological map soil type in a soil map elevation class in a elevation map that shows elevation as classes climate zone in a climate zone map Typical examples for the aggregate AGR are population, either as number of persons or as population density other socio-economic variables, summarised by area total emission of pollutants by region block mean NO\\(_2\\) concentrations, as e.g. obtained by block kriging or a dispersion model that predicts areal means A third type of AGR is that where an attribute identifies a feature geometry. The example above is county NAME: the name identifies the county, and is still the county NAME for any sub-area. identity the attribute value uniquely identifies the geometry as a whole, there are no other geometries with the same value For arbitrary sub-areas, the attribute will lose the identity property but becomes a constant attribute. An example is: any point inside a county is still part of the county and must have the same value for county name, but it does not longer represent the (entire) geometry corresponding to that county. The challenge here is that spatial information (ignoring time for simplicity) belongs to different phenomena types (e.g. Scheider et al. 2016), including fields: where over continuous space, every location corresponds to a single value, e.g. elevation objects: found a discrete set of locations, e.g. houses or persons aggregations: e.g. sums, totals, averages of fields, or spatial densities of objects but that different spatial geometry types (points, lines, polygons, raster cells) do not correspond to either of these: points may refer to samples of fields (air quality) or locations of objects lines may be used for objects (roads) or contours of a field raster pixels and polygons may reflect fields of a categorical variable such as land use (coverage), but also aggregates such as population density Properly specifying attribute-geometry relationships, and warning against their absence or cases when change of geometry (support) implies a change of information can help avoiding a large class of common spatial data analysis mistakes (Stasch et al. 2014) associated with the support of spatial data. 5.2 Spatial join In regular (left, right or inner) joins, joined records from a pair of tables are reported when one or more selected attributes match (are identical) in both tables. A spatial join is similar, but the criterion to join records is not equality of attributes but a spatial predicate. This leaves a wide variety of options in order to define spatially matching records, using binary predicates listed in section 3.2.2. The concepts of “left”, “right”, “inner” or “full” joins remain identical to the non-spatial join as the options for handling records that have no spatial match. When using spatial joins, each record may have many matched records, yielding a large result table. A way to reduce this complexity may be to select the matching record with the largest overlap with the target geometry. An example of this is shown (visually) in figure 5.1. # example of largest = TRUE: nc &lt;- st_transform(read_sf(system.file(&quot;shape/nc.shp&quot;, package=&quot;sf&quot;)), 2264) gr = st_sf( label = apply(expand.grid(1:10, LETTERS[10:1])[,2:1], 1, paste0, collapse = &quot; &quot;), geom = st_make_grid(nc)) gr$col = sf.colors(10, categorical = TRUE, alpha = .3) # cut, to check, NA&#39;s work out: gr = gr[-(1:30),] suppressWarnings(nc_j &lt;- st_join(nc, gr, largest = TRUE)) # the two datasets: opar = par(mfrow = c(2,1), mar = rep(0,4)) plot(st_geometry(nc_j)) plot(st_geometry(gr), add = TRUE, col = gr$col) text(st_coordinates(st_centroid(st_geometry(gr))), labels = gr$label) # the joined dataset: plot(st_geometry(nc_j), border = &#39;black&#39;, col = nc_j$col) text(st_coordinates(st_centroid(st_geometry(nc_j))), labels = nc_j$label, cex = .8) plot(st_geometry(gr), border = &#39;green&#39;, add = TRUE) par(opar) Figure 5.1: example of st_join with largest = TRUE: the label of the polygon in the top figure with the largest intersection with polygons in the bottom figure is assigned to the polygons of the bottom figure Another way to reduce the result set is to aggregate, after a join, all matching records, and union their geometry; this will now be discussed. 5.3 Aggregating and Summarising Aggregating records in a table (or data.frame) involves two steps grouping records based on a grouping predicate, and applying an aggregation function to the attribute values of a group to summarize them into a single number. In SQL, this looks for instance like SELECT GroupID, SUM(population) FROM table GROUP BY GroupID; indicating that the aggregation function (SUM) and the grouping predicate (region). R package dplyr for instance offers two functions: group_by which specifies the group membership of records and summarize which computes data summaries (such as sum or mean) for each of the groups. R (base) function aggregate does both in a single function that takes the data table, the grouping predicate(s) and the aggregation function. An example for the North Caroline counties is shown in figure 5.2. Here, we group counties by their position (according to the quadrant in which the county centroid is with respect to geographical coordinate POINT(-79, 35.5)) and count the number of disease cases per group. The result shows that the geometries of the resulting group have been unioned (section 3.2.6), which is necessary because the MULTIPOLYGON formed by just putting all the county geometries together would have many duplicate boundaries, and hence not be valid (section 3.1.2). nc &lt;- read_sf(system.file(&quot;gpkg/nc.gpkg&quot;, package=&quot;sf&quot;)) plot(nc[&quot;SID74&quot;], axes = TRUE) sf_use_s2(TRUE) # encode quadrant by two logicals: nc$lng = st_coordinates(st_centroid(st_geometry(nc)))[,1] &gt; -79 nc$lat = st_coordinates(st_centroid(st_geometry(nc)))[,2] &gt; 35.5 nc.grp = aggregate(nc[&quot;SID74&quot;], list(nc$lng, nc$lat), sum) plot(nc.grp[&quot;SID74&quot;], axes = TRUE) Figure 5.2: top: SID74 disease cases by county, bottom: summed values by county quadrant, county polygons unioned by county quadrant Plotting collated county polygons is technically not a problem, but for this case would raise the wrong suggestion that the group sums relate to the counties, and not the group of counties. Subsequent geometrical operations on such invalid polygon collections would however fail (and require a union or make_valid first). One particular property of aggregation in this way is that each record is assigned to a single group; this has the advantage that the sum of the group-wise sums equals the sum of the ungrouped data: for variables that reflect amount, nothing gets lost and nothing is added. The newly formed geometry is the result of unioning the geometries of the records. When we need an aggregate for a new area that is not a union of the geometries for a group of records, and we use a spatial predicate then we may end up with a case where records are matched to multiple groups. When taking the rectangles of figure ?? as the target areas, and we sum for each rectangle the disease cases of the counties that intersect with the rectangle, the sum of these will be much larger: nc &lt;- st_transform(nc, 2264) a = aggregate(nc[&quot;SID74&quot;], gr, sum) c(sid74_sum_counties = sum(nc$SID74), sid74_sum_rectangles = sum(a$SID74, na.rm = TRUE)) # sid74_sum_counties sid74_sum_rectangles # 667 2282 Choosing another predicate, e.g. contains or covers would on the contrary result in much smaller values, because many counties are not contained by any the target geometries. However, there are a few cases where this approach might be good or satisfactory: when we want to aggregate POINT geometries by a set of polygons, and all points are contained by a polygon. If points fall on a shared boundary than they are assigned to both polygons (this is the case for DE-9IM-based GEOS library; the s2geometry library has the option to define polygons as “semi-open”, which implies that points are assigned to single polygons when the polygons form a coverage) when aggregating many very small polygons or raster pixels over larger areas, e.g. averaging altitude from 30 m resolution raster over North Carolina counties, the error made by multiple matches may be insignificant. A more comprehensive approach to aggregating spatial data associated to areas to larger, arbitrary shaped areas is by using area-weighted interpolation. 5.4 Area-weighted interpolation When we want to combine geometries and attributes of two datasets such that we get attribute values of a source dataset summarised for the geometries of a target, where source and target geometries are unrelated, area-weighted interpolation may be a simple approach. In effect, it considers the area of overlap of the source and target geometries, and uses that to weight the source attribute values into the target value (Goodchild and Lam 1980; Do, Thomas-Agnan, and Vanhems 2015a, 2015b). Here, we follow the notation of (Do, Thomas-Agnan, and Vanhems 2015b). Area-weighted interpolation computes for each of \\(q\\) spatial target areas \\(T_j\\) a weighted average from the values \\(Y_i\\) corresponding to the \\(p\\) spatial source areas \\(S_i\\), \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{Y}_j(T_j) = \\sum_{i=1}^p w_{ij} Y_i(S_i) \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] where the \\(w_{ij}\\) depend on the amount of overlap of \\(T_j\\) and \\(S_i\\), \\(A_{ij} = T_j \\cap S_i\\). Different options exist for choosing weights, including methods using external variables (e.g. dasymetric mapping, (Mennis 2003)). Two simple approaches for computing weights that do not use external variables arise, depending on whether the variable \\(Z\\) is intensive or extensive. 5.4.1 Spatially extensive and intensive variables An example of an extensive variable is population count. It is associated with an area, and if that area is cut into smaller areas, the population count is split accordingly: not necessary proportional to area, because population is rarely uniform, but split in such a way that the sum of the population count for the smaller areas equals that of the total. An example of a related variable that is intensive is population density. If an an area is split into smaller areas, population density is not split similarly: the sum of the population densities for the smaller areas is a meaningless measure, as opposed to the average of the population densities which will be similar to the density of the total area. Extensive variables correspond to amounts, associated with a physical size (length, area, volume); for spatially extensive variables, if the area a value corresponds to is cut in parts, the values associated with the sub-area are split accordingly. In other words: the value is proportional to the support. Intensive variables are variables that do not have values proportional to support: if the area is split, values may vary but on average remain the same. The corresponding example of an intensive variable is population density: when we split an area into sub-areas, the sub-areas either have identical population densities (in case population is uniformly distributed) or, more realistically, have varying population densities that by necessity are both higher and lower than the density of the total area. When we assume that the extensive variable \\(Y\\) is uniformly distributed over space, the value \\(Y_{ij}\\), derived from \\(Y_i\\) for a sub-area of \\(S_i\\), \\(A_{ij} = T_j \\cap S_i\\) of \\(S_i\\) is \\[\\hat{Y}_{ij}(A_{ij}) = \\frac{|A_{ij}|}{|S_i|} Y_i(S_i)\\] where \\(|\\cdot|\\) denotes the spatial area. For estimating \\(Y_j(T_j)\\) we sum all the elements over area \\(T_j\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{Y}_j(T_j) = \\sum_{i=1}^p \\frac{|A_{ij}|}{|S_i|} Y_i(S_i) \\tag{5.2} \\end{equation}\\] For an intensive variable, under the assumption that the variable has a constant value over each area \\(S_i\\), the estimate for a sub-area equals that of the total, \\[\\hat{Y}_{ij} = Y_i(S_i)\\] and we can estimate the value of \\(Y\\) for a new spatial unit \\(T_j\\) by an area-weighted average of the source values: \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{Y}_j(T_j) = \\sum_{i=1}^p \\frac{|A_{ij}|}{|T_j|} Y_i(S_i) \\tag{5.3} \\end{equation}\\] 5.4.2 Dasymetric mapping Dasymetric mapping distributes variables, such as population, known at a course spatial aggregation level over finer spatial units by using other variables that are associated with population distribution, such as land use, building density, or road density. The simplest approach to dasymetric mapping is obtained for extensive variables, where the ratio \\(|A_{ij}| / |S_i|\\) in (5.2) is replaced by the ratio of another extensive variable \\(X_{ij}(S_{ij})/X_i(S_i)\\), which has to be known for both the intersecting regions \\(S_{ij}\\) and the source regions \\(S_i\\). (Do, Thomas-Agnan, and Vanhems 2015b) discuss several alternatives for intensive \\(Y\\) and/or \\(X\\), and cases where \\(X\\) is known for other areas. 5.4.3 Aggregation and disaggregation The application of areal interpolation using (5.1) with its realisations for extensive (5.2) and intensive (5.3) variables allows moving information from any source area \\(S_i\\) to any target area \\(T_j\\) as long as the two areas have some overlap. This means that one can go arbitrarily to much larger units (aggregation) or to much smaller units (disaggregation). Of course this makes only sense to the extent that the assumptions hold: over the source regions extensive variables need to be uniformly distributed and intensive variables need to have constant value. The ultimate disaggregation involves retrieving (extracting) point values from line or area data. For this, we cannot work with equations (5.2) or (5.3) because \\(|A_{ij}| = 0\\) for points, but under the assumption of having a constant value over the geometry, for intensive variables the value \\(Y_i(S_i)\\) can be assigned to points as long as all points can be uniquely assigned to a single source area \\(S_i\\). For polygon data, this implies that \\(Y\\) needs to be a coverage variable (section 3.4). In cases where values associated with areas are aggregate values over the area, the assumptions made by area-weighted interpolation or dasymetric mapping – uniformity or constant values over the source areas – are highly unrealistic. In such cases, these simple approaches still be reasonable approximations, for instance when the source and target area are nearly identical the variability inside source units is very small, and the variable is nearly uniform or constant. In other cases, results obtained using these methods are merely consequences of unjustified assumptions. Statistical aggregation methods that can estimate quantities for larger regions from points or smaller regions include design-based methods, which require that a probability sample is available from the target region, with known inclusion probabilities, and model-based methods, which assume a random field model with spatially correlated values (block kriging, section ??). Alternative disaggregation methods include deterministic, smoothing-based approaches: kernel- or spline-based smoothing methods (Tobler 1979; Martin 1989) statistical, model-based approaches: area-to-area and area-to-point kriging (Kyriakidis 2004), see section ?? 5.5 Exercises Add a variable to the nc dataset by nc$State = \"North Carolina\". Which value should you attach to this variable for the attribute-geometry relationship (agr)?

Raster and vector datacubes refer to array data, where one or more of the dimensions refer to space, and often other dimensions refer to time. 6.1 Package stars Athough package sp has always had limited support for raster data, over the last decade R package raster has clearly been dominant as the prime package for powerful, flexible and scalable raster analysis. Its data model is that of a 2D raster, or a set of raster layers (a “raster stack”). This follows the classical static GIS world view, where the world is modelled as a set of layers, each representing a different theme. A lot of data available today however is dynamic, and comes as time series of rasters for different themes. A raster stack does not meaningfully reflect this, requiring the user to do shadow book keeping of which layer represents what. Also, the raster package does an excellent job in scaling computations up to datasizes no larger than the local storage (the computer’s hard drives). Recent datasets however, including satellite imagery, climate model or weather forecasting data, often no longer fit in local storage. Package spacetime addresses the analysis of time series of vector geometries or raster grid cells, but does not extend to higher-dimensional arrays. Here, we introduce a new package for raster analysis, called stars (for scalable, spatiotemporal tidy arrays) that allows for representing dynamic raster stacks, in addition to regular grids handles rotated, sheared, rectilinear and curvilinear rasters, provides a tight integration with package sf, follows the tidyverse design principles, aims at being scalable, also beyond local disk size, also handles array data with non-raster spatial dimensions, the vector datacubes, provides further integration of novel features in the GDAL library than other R packages have given so far. Vector data cubes include for instance time series for simple features, or spatial graph data such as origin-destination matrices. The wider concept of spatial vector and raster data cubes is explained in section 6.3 6.2 Raster data As introduced in section 3.4, raster data are spatial datasets where observations are aligned on a regular grid usually with square grid cells (in some coordinate reference system, chapter 8). Raster datasets are used often to represent spatially continuously varying phenomena such as temperature or elevation, and also for observed imagery for instance obtained from satellites. 6.2.1 Reading and writing raster data Raster data typically are read from a file. We read an example file of a regular, non-rotated grid from the package stars: tif = system.file(&quot;tif/L7_ETMs.tif&quot;, package = &quot;stars&quot;) library(stars) x = read_stars(tif) The dataset contains (a section of) a Landsat 7 scene, with the 6 30m-resolution bands (bands 1-5 and 7) for a region covering the city of Olinda, Brazil. A short summary of the data is given by x # stars object with 3 dimensions and 1 attribute # attribute(s): # L7_ETMs.tif # Min. : 1.0 # 1st Qu.: 54.0 # Median : 69.0 # Mean : 68.9 # 3rd Qu.: 86.0 # Max. :255.0 # dimension(s): # from to offset delta refsys point values x/y # x 1 349 288776 28.5 UTM Zone 25, Southern Hem...

As for simple features, reading and writing uses the GDAL library; the list of available drivers for raster data is obtained by st_drivers(&quot;raster&quot;) 6.2.2 Plotting raster data We can use the base plot method for stars objects, shown in figure 6.1. plot(x) Figure 6.1: 6 30m Landsat bands downsampled to 90m for Olinda, Br. The default color scale uses grey tones, and stretches this such that color breaks correspond to data quantiles over all bands. A more familiar view is the rgb or false color composite: par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) plot(x, rgb = c(3,2,1), reset = FALSE, main = &quot;RGB&quot;) # rgb plot(x, rgb = c(4,3,2), main = &quot;False color (NIR-R-G)&quot;) # false color Figure 6.2: two RGB composites 6.2.3 Analysing raster data Element-wise mathematical operations on stars objects are just passed on to the arrays. This means that we can call functions and create expressions: log(x) # stars object with 3 dimensions and 1 attribute # attribute(s): # L7_ETMs.tif # Min. :0.00 # 1st Qu.:3.99 # Median :4.23 # Mean :4.12 # 3rd Qu.:4.45 # Max. :5.54 # dimension(s): # from to offset delta refsys point values x/y # x 1 349 288776 28.5 UTM Zone 25, Southern Hem...

FALSE NULL [x] # y 1 352 9120761 -28.5 UTM Zone 25, Southern Hem... FALSE NULL [y] # band 1 6 NA NA NA NA NULL Dimension-wise, we can apply functions to array dimensions of stars objects just like apply does this to matrices. For instance, to compute for each pixel the mean of the 6 band values we can do st_apply(x, c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;), mean) # stars object with 2 dimensions and 1 attribute # attribute(s): # mean # Min. : 25.5 # 1st Qu.: 53.3 # Median : 68.3 # Mean : 68.9 # 3rd Qu.: 82.0 # Max. :255.0 # dimension(s): # from to offset delta refsys point values x/y # x 1 349 288776 28.5 UTM Zone 25, Southern Hem... FALSE NULL [x] # y 1 352 9120761 -28.5 UTM Zone 25, Southern Hem... FALSE NULL [y] A more meaningful function would e.g. compute the NDVI (normalized differenced vegetation index): ndvi = function(x) (x[4]-x[3])/(x[4]+x[3]) st_apply(x, c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;), ndvi) # stars object with 2 dimensions and 1 attribute # attribute(s): # ndvi # Min. :-0.753 # 1st Qu.:-0.203 # Median :-0.069 # Mean :-0.064 # 3rd Qu.: 0.187 # Max. : 0.587 # dimension(s): # from to offset delta refsys point values x/y # x 1 349 288776 28.5 UTM Zone 25, Southern Hem... FALSE NULL [x] # y 1 352 9120761 -28.5 UTM Zone 25, Southern Hem... FALSE NULL [y] Alternatively, to compute for each band the mean of the whole image we can do as.data.frame(st_apply(x, c(&quot;band&quot;), mean)) # band mean # 1 1 79.1 # 2 2 67.6 # 3 3 64.4 # 4 4 59.2 # 5 5 83.2 # 6 6 60.0 which is so small it can be printed here as a data.frame. In these two examples, entire dimensions disappear. Sometimes, this does not happen; we can for instance compute the three quartiles for each band st_apply(x, c(&quot;band&quot;), quantile, c(.25, .5, .75)) # stars object with 2 dimensions and 1 attribute # attribute(s): # L7_ETMs.tif # Min. : 32.0 # 1st Qu.: 60.8 # Median : 66.5 # Mean : 69.8 # 3rd Qu.: 78.8 # Max. :112.0 # dimension(s): # from to offset delta refsys point values # quantile 1 3 NA NA NA NA 25%, 50%, 75% # band 1 6 NA NA NA NA NULL and see that this creates a new dimension, quantile, with three values. Alternatively, the three quantiles over the 6 bands for each pixel are obtained by st_apply(x, c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;), quantile, c(.25, .5, .75)) # stars object with 3 dimensions and 1 attribute # attribute(s): # L7_ETMs.tif # Min. : 4.0 # 1st Qu.: 55.0 # Median : 69.2 # Mean : 67.2 # 3rd Qu.: 81.2 # Max. :255.0 # dimension(s): # from to offset delta refsys point # quantile 1 3 NA NA NA NA # x 1 349 288776 28.5 UTM Zone 25, Southern Hem...

FALSE # values x/y # quantile 25%, 50%, 75% # x NULL [x] # y NULL [y] 6.2.4 Raster varieties: rectilinear, curvilinear Besides the regular raster with square cells and axes aligned with \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), several other raster types exist. The ones supported by package stars are shown in figure 6.3. Figure 6.3: raster types supported by the stars package The data model vignette of the package explains the models in detail, and points out how they can be constructed. There are several reasons why non-regular rasters occur. For one, when the data is Earth-bound, a regular raster does not fit the Earth surface, which is curved. Other reasons are: when we convert or transform a regular raster data into another coordinate reference system, it will become curvilinear unless we resample; resampling always goes at the cost of some loss of data and is not reversible. observation may lead to irregular rasters; e.g. for satellite swaths, we may have a regular raster in the direction of the satellite (not aligned with \\(x\\) or \\(y\\)), and rectilinear perpendicular to that (e.g. if the sensor discretizes the viewing angle in equal sections) 6.2.5 Handling large raster datasets A common challenge with raster datasets is not only that they come in large files (single Sentinel-2 tiles are around 1 Gb), but that many of these files, potentially thousands, are needed to address the area and time period of interest. At time of writing this, the Copernicus program which runs all Sentinel satellites publishes 160 Tb of images per day. This means that a classic pattern in using R, consisting of downloading data to local disc, loading the data in memory, analysing it is not going to work. Cloud-based Earth Observation processing platforms like Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al. 2017) or Sentinel Hub recognize this and let users work with datasets up to 20 petabyte rather easily and with a great deal of interactivity. They share the following properties: computations are posponed as long as possible (lazy evaluation), only the data you ask for are being computed and returned, and nothing more, storing intermediate results is avoided in favour of on-the-fly computations, maps with useful results are generated and shown quickly to allow for interactive model development. This is similar to the dbplyr interface to databases and cloud-based analytics environments, but differs in the aspect of what we want to see quickly: rather than the first \\(n\\) records, we want a quick overview of the results, in the form of a map covering the whole area, or part of it, but at screen resolution rather than native (observation) resolution. If for instance we want to “see” results for the United States on screen with 1000 x 1000 pixels, we only need to compute results for this many pixels, which corresponds roughly to data on a grid with 3000 m x 3000 m grid cells. For Sentinel-2 data with 10 m resolution, this means we can subsample with a factor 300, giving 3 km x 3 km resolution. Processing, storage and network requirements then drop a factor \\(300^2 \\approx 10^5\\), compared to working on the native 10 m x 10 m resolution. On the platforms mentioned, zooming in the map triggers further computations on a finer resolution and smaller extent. A simple optimisation that follows these lines is how stars’ plot method works: in case of plotting large rasters, it subsamples the array before it plots, drastically saving time. The degree of subsampling is derived from the plotting region size and the plotting resolution (pixel density). For vector devices, such as pdf, R sets plot resolution to 75 dpi, corresponding to 0.3 mm per pixel. Enlarging plots may reveal this, but replotting to an enlarged devices will create a plot at target density. 6.2.6 stars proxy objects To handle datasets that are too large to fit in memory, stars provides stars_proxy objects. To demonstrate its use, we will use the starsdata package, an R data package with larger datasets (around 1 Gb total). It can be installed by install.packages(&quot;starsdata&quot;, repos = &quot;http://pebesma.staff.ifgi.de&quot;, type = &quot;source&quot;) We can “load” a Sentinel-2 image from it by granule = system.file(&quot;sentinel/S2A_MSIL1C_20180220T105051_N0206_R051_T32ULE_20180221T134037.zip&quot;, package = &quot;starsdata&quot;) file.size(granule) # [1] 7.69e+08 base_name = strsplit(basename(granule), &quot;.zip&quot;)[[1]] s2 = paste0(&quot;SENTINEL2_L1C:/vsizip/&quot;, granule, &quot;/&quot;, base_name, &quot;.SAFE/MTD_MSIL1C.xml:10m:EPSG_32632&quot;) (p = read_stars(s2, proxy = TRUE)) # stars_proxy object with 1 attribute in 1 file(s): # $`MTD_MSIL1C.xml:10m:EPSG_32632` # [1] &quot;[...]/MTD_MSIL1C.xml:10m:EPSG_32632&quot; # # dimension(s): # from to offset delta refsys point values x/y # x 1 10980 3e+05 10 WGS 84 / UTM zone 32N NA NULL [x] # y 1 10980 6e+06 -10 WGS 84 / UTM zone 32N NA NULL [y] # band 1 4 NA NA NA NA B4,...,B8 object.size(p) # 11160 bytes and we see that this does not actually load any of the pixel values, but keeps the reference to the dataset and fills the dimensions table. (The convoluted s2 name is needed to point GDAL to the right file inside the .zip file containing 115 files in total). The idea of a proxy object is that we can build expressions like p2 = p * 2 but that the computations for this are postponed. Only when we really need the data, e.g. because we want to plot it, is p * 2 evaluated. We need data when either we want to plot data, or we want to write an object to disk, with write_stars, or we want to explicitly load an object in memory, with st_as_stars In case the entire object does not fit in memory, plot and write_stars choose different strategies to deal with this: plot fetches only the pixels that can be seen, rather than all pixels available, and write_stars reads, processes, and writes data chunk by chunk. Downsampling and chunking is implemented for spatially dense images, not e.g. for dense time series, or other dense dimensions. As an example, plot(p) only fetches the pixels that can be seen on the plot device, rather than the 10980 x 10980 pixels available in each band. The downsampling ratio taken is floor(sqrt(prod(dim(p)) / prod(dev.size(&quot;px&quot;)))) # [1] 19 meaning that for every 19 x 19 sub-image in the original image, only one pixel is read, and plotted. This value is still a bit too high as it ignores the white space and space for the key on the plotting device. 6.2.7 Operations on proxy objects A few dedicated methods are available for stars_proxy objects: methods(class = &quot;stars_proxy&quot;) # [1] [ [[&lt;- adrop aggregate aperm # [6] as.data.frame c coerce dim droplevels # [11] filter initialize mapView Math merge # [16] mutate Ops plot predict print # [21] pull select show slice slotsFromS3 # [26] split st_apply st_as_sf st_as_stars st_crop # [31] st_mosaic st_redimension st_sample st_set_bbox transmute # [36] write_stars # see &#39;?methods&#39; for accessing help and source code We have seen plot and print in action; dim reads out the dimension from the dimensions metadata table. The three methods that actually fetch data are st_as_stars, plot and write_stars. st_as_stars reads the actual data into a stars object, its argument downsample controls the downsampling rate. plot does this too, choosing an appropriate downsample value from the device resolution, and plots the object. write_stars writes a star_proxy object to disc. All other methods for stars_proxy objects do not actually operate on the raster data but add the operations to a to do list, attached to the object. Only when actual raster data are fetched, e.g. by calling plot or st_as_stars, the commands in this list are executed. st_crop limits the extent (area) of the raster that will be read. c combines stars_proxy objects, but still doesn’t read any data. adrop drops empty dimensions, aperm changes dimension order. write_stars reads and processes its input chunk-wise; it has an argument chunk_size that lets users control the size of spatial chunks. 6.3 Vector Datacubes Data cubes are multi-dimensional array data, where array dimensions are meaningfully related to categorical or continuous variables that may include space and time (Lu, Appel, and Pebesma 2018). We have seen raster data cubes so far, e.g. raster data naturally fit in two-dimensional arrays, multi-spectral raster data fit in three-dimensional arrays (cubes), and time series of multi-spectral raster data fit in four-dimensional arrays (hyper-cubes). Besides Earth Observation/satellite imagery data, a large class of datacubes come from modelling data, e.g. from oceanographic, meteorologic or climate models, where dimensions may include latitude and longitude altitude, or depth pressure level (substituting altitude) time time to forecast, in addition to time when a forecast was made we can add to this as an additional dimension variable of interest (pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed, salinity, …) when we accept that categorical variables also “take” a dimension. The alternative would be to consider these as “fields”, or “attributes” of array records. Being able to swap dimensions to attributes flexibly and vice-versa leads to powerful analysis, as e.g. shown by the powerful array database SciDB (Brown 2010). We go from raster data cubes to vector data cubes if we replace the two or three raster dimensions with one dimension listing a set of feature geometries (points, lines or polygons). One example would be air quality data, where we could have \\(PM_{10}\\) measurements for a set of monitoring stations, and a sequence of time intervals aligned in a vector data cube. Another example would be demographic or epidemiological data, where we have a time series of (population, disease) counts, with number of persons by region, for \\(n\\) regions by age class, for \\(m\\) age classes, and by year, for \\(p\\) years. which forms an array with \\(n m p\\) elements. R has strong native support for arbitrarily dimensioned arrays, and we can get the value for year \\(i\\), age class \\(j\\) and year \\(k\\) from array a by a[i,j,k] and e.g. the sub-array for age class \\(j\\) by a[,j,] Thinking along the classical GIS lines, where we would have either raster or vector data, one is left with the question what to do when we have a raster time series data cube (e.g. a climate model forecast) and want to obtain a vector time series data cube with aggregates of the model forecast over polygons, as time series. For spatial data science, support of vector and raster data cubes is extremely useful, because many variables are both spatially and temporaly varying, and because we often want to either change dimensions or aggregate them out, but in a fully flexible manner and order. Examples of changing dimensions are interpolating air quality measurements to values on a regular grid (raster) estimating density maps from points or lines, e.g. with the number of flights passing by per week within a range of 1 km aggregating climate model predictions to summary indicators for administrative regions combining Earth observation data from different sensors, e.g. Modis (250 m pixels, every 16 days) with Sentinel-2 (10 m, every 5 days). Examples of aggregating one ore more full dimensions are assessments of which air quality monitoring stations indicate unhealthy conditions which region has the highest increase in disease incidence global warming (e.g. in degrees per year) 6.3.1 Example: aggregating air quality time series Air quality data from package spacetime were obtained from the airBase European air quality data base. Downloaded were daily average PM\\(_{10}\\) values for rural background stations in Germany, 1998-2009. We can create a stars object from the air matrix, the dates Date vector and the stations SpatialPoints objects by library(spacetime) data(air) # this loads several datasets in .GlobalEnv dim(air) # space time # 70 4383 d = st_dimensions(station = st_as_sfc(stations), time = dates) (aq = st_as_stars(list(PM10 = air), dimensions = d)) # stars object with 2 dimensions and 1 attribute # attribute(s): # PM10 # Min. : 0 # 1st Qu.: 10 # Median : 15 # Mean : 18 # 3rd Qu.: 22 # Max. :274 # NA&#39;s :157659 # dimension(s): # from to offset delta refsys point # station 1 70 NA NA +proj=longlat +datum=WGS8...

Figure 6.5 shows the spatial distribution measurement stations and mean PM\\(_{10}\\) values. image(aperm(log(aq), 2:1), main = &quot;NA pattern (white) in PM10 station time series&quot;) Figure 6.4: space-time diagram of PM\\(_{10}\\) measurements by time and station plot(st_as_sf(st_apply(aq, 1, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), reset = FALSE, pch = 16, ylim = st_bbox(DE)[c(2,4)]) # Warning in sp::proj4string(obj): CRS object has comment, which is lost in output plot(DE, add=TRUE) Figure 6.5: locations of PM\\(_{10}\\) measurement stations, showing mean values We can now aggregate these station time series to area means, mostly as a simple exercise. For this, we use the aggregate method for stars objects (a = aggregate(aq, st_as_sf(DE_NUTS1), mean, na.rm = TRUE)) # stars object with 2 dimensions and 1 attribute # attribute(s): # PM10 # Min. : 1 # 1st Qu.: 11 # Median : 15 # Mean : 18 # 3rd Qu.: 22 # Max. :172 # NA&#39;s :25679 # dimension(s): # from to offset delta refsys point # geometry 1 16 NA NA +proj=longlat +datum=WGS8...

We have feature geometries for the 102 origin and destination regions, shown in figure 6.8. library(spDataLarge) plot(st_geometry(bristol_zones), axes = TRUE, graticule = TRUE) plot(st_geometry(bristol_zones)[33], col = &#39;red&#39;, add = TRUE) Figure 6.8: Origin destination data zones for Bristol, UK, with zone 33 (E02003043) colored red and the OD counts come in a table with OD pairs as records, and transportation mode as variables: head(bristol_od) # # A tibble: 6 x 7 # o d all bicycle foot car_driver train # &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; # 1 E02002985 E02002985 209 5 127 59 0 # 2 E02002985 E02002987 121 7 35 62 0 # 3 E02002985 E02003036 32 2 1 10 1 # 4 E02002985 E02003043 141 1 2 56 17 # 5 E02002985 E02003049 56 2 4 36 0 # 6 E02002985 E02003054 42 4 0 21 0 We see that many combinations of origin and destination are implicit zeroes, otherwise these two numbers would have been the same: nrow(bristol_zones)^2 # [1] 10404 nrow(bristol_od) # [1] 2910 We will form a three-dimensional vector datacube with origin, destination and transportation mode as dimensions. For this, we first “tidy” the bristol_od table to have origin (o), destination (d), transportation mode (mode), and count (n) as variables, using gather: # create O-D-mode array: bristol_tidy &lt;- bristol_od %&gt;% select(-all) %&gt;% gather(&quot;mode&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, -o, -d) head(bristol_tidy) # # A tibble: 6 x 4 # o d mode n # &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; # 1 E02002985 E02002985 bicycle 5 # 2 E02002985 E02002987 bicycle 7 # 3 E02002985 E02003036 bicycle 2 # 4 E02002985 E02003043 bicycle 1 # 5 E02002985 E02003049 bicycle 2 # 6 E02002985 E02003054 bicycle 4 Next, we form the three-dimensional array a, filled with zeroes: od = bristol_tidy %&gt;% pull(&quot;o&quot;) %&gt;% unique nod = length(od) mode = bristol_tidy %&gt;% pull(&quot;mode&quot;) %&gt;% unique nmode = length(mode) a = array(0L, c(nod, nod, nmode), dimnames = list(o = od, d = od, mode = mode)) We see that the dimensions are named with the zone names (o, d) and the transportation mode name (mode). Every row of bristol_tidy denotes an array entry, and we can use this to to fill the non-zero entries of the bristol_tidy table with their appropriate value (n): a[as.matrix(bristol_tidy[c(&quot;o&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;mode&quot;)])] = bristol_tidy$n To be sure that there is not an order mismatch between the zones in bristol_zones and the zone names in bristol_tidy, we can get the right set of zones by: order = match(od, bristol_zones$geo_code) # it happens this equals 1:102 zones = st_geometry(bristol_zones)[order] (It happens that the order is already correct, but it is good practice to not assume this). Next, with zones and modes we can create a stars dimensions object: library(stars) (d = st_dimensions(o = zones, d = zones, mode = mode)) # from to offset delta refsys point # o 1 102 NA NA WGS 84 FALSE # d 1 102 NA NA WGS 84 FALSE # mode 1 4 NA NA NA FALSE # values # o MULTIPOLYGON (((-2.51 51.4,...,...,MULTIPOLYGON (((-2.55 51.5,... # d MULTIPOLYGON (((-2.51 51.4,...,...,MULTIPOLYGON (((-2.55 51.5,... # mode bicycle,...,train and finally build or stars object from a and d: (odm = st_as_stars(list(N = a), dimensions = d)) # stars object with 3 dimensions and 1 attribute # attribute(s): # N # Min. : 0 # 1st Qu.: 0 # Median : 0 # Mean : 5 # 3rd Qu.: 0 # Max. :1296 # dimension(s): # from to offset delta refsys point # o 1 102 NA NA WGS 84 FALSE # d 1 102 NA NA WGS 84 FALSE # mode 1 4 NA NA NA FALSE # values # o MULTIPOLYGON (((-2.51 51.4,...,...,MULTIPOLYGON (((-2.55 51.5,... # d MULTIPOLYGON (((-2.51 51.4,...,...,MULTIPOLYGON (((-2.55 51.5,... # mode bicycle,...,train We can take a single slice through from this three-dimensional array, e.g. for zone 33 (figure 6.8), by odm[,,33], and plot it: plot(odm[,,33] + 1, logz = TRUE) # Warning in st_as_sf.stars(x): working on the first sfc dimension only # Warning in st_bbox.dimensions(st_dimensions(obj), ...): returning the bounding # box of the first geometry dimension # Warning in st_bbox.dimensions(st_dimensions(obj), ...): returning the bounding # box of the first geometry dimension Subsetting this way, we take all attributes (there is only one: N) since the first argument is empty, we take all origin regions (second argument empty), we take destination zone 33 (third argument), and all transportation modes (fourth argument empty, or missing). We plotted this particular zone because it has the largest number of travelers as its destination. We can find this out by summing all origins and travel modes by destination: d = st_apply(odm, 2, sum) which.max(d[[1]]) # [1] 33 Other aggregations we can carry out include: total transportation by OD (102 x 102): st_apply(odm, 1:2, sum) # stars object with 2 dimensions and 1 attribute # attribute(s): # sum # Min. : 0 # 1st Qu.: 0 # Median : 0 # Mean : 19 # 3rd Qu.: 19 # Max. :1434 # dimension(s): # from to offset delta refsys point # o 1 102 NA NA WGS 84 FALSE # d 1 102 NA NA WGS 84 FALSE # values # o MULTIPOLYGON (((-2.51 51.4,...,...,MULTIPOLYGON (((-2.55 51.5,... # d MULTIPOLYGON (((-2.51 51.4,...,...,MULTIPOLYGON (((-2.55 51.5,...

To take out the amount in the count, we can compute densities (count / km\\(^2\\)), by library(units) # udunits database from /usr/share/xml/udunits/udunits2.xml a = as.numeric(set_units(st_area(st_as_sf(o)), km^2)) dens_o = o / a dens_d = d / a plot(c(dens_o, dens_d, along = list(od = c(&quot;origin&quot;, &quot;destination&quot;))), logz = TRUE) 6.3.3 Are datacubes tidy? Yes! The tidy data paper (Wickham 2014b) may suggest that such array data should be processed not as an array, but in a long table where each row holds (region, class, year, value), and it is always good to be able to do this. For primary handling and storage however, this is often not an option, because a lot of array data are collected or generated as array data, e.g. by imagery or other sensory devices, or e.g. by climate models it is easier to derive the long table form from the array than vice versa the long table form requires much more memory, since the space occupied by dimension values is \\(O(nmp)\\), rather than \\(O(n+m+p)\\) when missing-valued cells are dropped, the long table form loses the implicit indexing of the array form To put this argument to the extreme, consider for instance that all image, video and sound data are stored in array form; few people would make a real case for storing them in a long table form instead. Nevertheless, R packages like tsibble take this approach, and have to deal with ambiguous ordering of multiple records with identical time steps for different spatial features and index them, which is solved for both automatically by using the array form. Package stars tries to follow the tidy manifesto to handle array sets, and has particularly developed support for the case where one or more of the dimensions refer to space, and/or time. 6.4 Exercises NDVI, normalized differenced vegetation index, is coputed as (NIR-R)/(NIR+R), with NIR the near infrared and R the red band. Read the L7_ETMs.tif file into object x, and distribute the band dimensions over attributes by split(x, \"band\"). Then, compute NDVI by using an expression that uses the NIR (band 4) and R (band 3) attributes directly. Compute NDVI for the S2 image, using st_apply and an a function ndvi = function(x) (x[4]-x[3])/(x[4]+x[3]). Plot the result, and write the result to a GeoTIFF. Explain the difference in runtime between plotting and writing. Use st_transform to transform the stars object read from L7_ETMs.tif to EPSG 4326. Print the object. Is this a regular grid? Plot the first band using arguments axes=TRUE and border=NA, and explain why this takes such a long time. Use st_warp to warp the L7_ETMs.tif object to EPSG 4326, and plot the resulting object with axes=TRUE. Why is the plot created much faster than after st_transform?

(2012)) defines a quantity as a “property of a phenomenon, body, or substance, where the property has a magnitude that can be expressed as a number and a reference”, where “[a] reference can be a measurement unit, a measurement procedure, a reference material, or a combination of such.” One could argue whether all data is constituted of quantities, but there is no need to argue that proper data handling requires that numbers are accompanied by information on what the numbers mean, and what they are about. A measurement system consist of base units for base quantities, and derived units for derived quantities. The SI system of units (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures 2006) consist of the seven base units length (metre, m), mass (kilogram, kg), time (second, s), electric current (ampere, A), thermodynamic temperature (kelvin, K), amount of substance (mole, mol), and luminous intensity (candela, cd). Derived units are composed of products of integer powers of base units; exampes are speed (\\(\\mbox{m}~\\mbox{s}^{-1}\\)) and density (\\(\\mbox{kg}~\\mbox{m}^{-3}\\)). Many data variables have units that are not expressed as SI base units or derived units. Hand (2004) discusses many such measurement scales, e.g. those used to measure intelligence in social sciences, in the context of measurement units. 8.1.2 Unitless measures The special case of unitless units can refer to either cases where units cancelled out (e.g. mass fraction: kg/kg, or angle measured in rad: m/m) or to cases where objects or events were counted (e.g. 5 apples). Adding an angle to a count of apples would not make sense; adding 5 apples to 3 oranges may make sense if the result is reinterpreted, e.g. as pieces of fruit. Flater (2018) discusses systems for proper handling of unitless quantities; handling counts could for instance link to domain-specific ontologies pointing out which things were counted, and perhaps identifying super-classes, like fruit. 8.1.3 Units in R The units R package (Pebesma, Mailund, and Hiebert 2016) provides units of measurement support for R, by interfacing the udunits2 units database and C library. It allows for setting, converting and deriving units: library(units) (a = set_units(1:3, m)) # Units: [m] # [1] 1 2 3 a_km = set_units(1:3, km) a + a_km # Units: [m] # [1] 1001 2002 3003 b = set_units(4:6, s) a / b # Units: [m/s] # [1] 0.25 0.40 0.50 and raises errors in case of meaningless operations a + b # Error: cannot convert s into m 8.1.4 Datum For many quantities, the natural origin of values is zero. This works for amounts, and differences between amounts results in meaningful negative values. For locations and times, differences have a natural zero interpretation: length and duration. Absolute location (position) and time need a fixed origin, from which we can meaningfully measure other absolute space-time points: a datum. For space, a datum involves more than one dimension. The combination of a datum and a measurement unit (scale) is a a reference system. The next two sections will deal with temporal and spatial reference systems, and how they are handled in R. 8.2 Temporal Reference Systems R has two native classes for time-related data: POSIXt and Date, which are used for specifying dates, and times. 8.2.1 Date Date objects are numeric vectors of class Date, which contain the number of days since (or in case negative: before) Jan 1, 1970: (d = as.Date(&quot;1970-02-01&quot;)) # [1] &quot;1970-02-01&quot; as.numeric(d) # [1] 31 We see that the print method as well as the as.Date method use ISO 8601 (ISO8601 2000) character strings, which is standard used to read and write dates. We can also modify this to local conventions by specifying a format: (d = as.Date(&quot;01.02.1970&quot;, format = &quot;%d.%m.%Y&quot;)) # [1] &quot;1970-02-01&quot; format(d, format = &quot;%d.%m.%Y&quot;) # [1] &quot;01.02.1970&quot; The default for format may depend on the locale settings of the computer used. The help page of ?as.Date contains further discussion of date systems, and calendars used. 8.2.2 POSIXt POSIXt is an R native class for specifying times. It has two subclasses: POSIXct represents time as a numeric, representing decimal seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC, and POSIXlt contains the same information as a list with all time components (second, minute, hour, day of month, month, year) in list components: t = as.POSIXct(&quot;1970-01-01 01:00:00&quot;, tz = &quot;UTC&quot;) as.numeric(t) # [1] 3600 names(unclass(as.POSIXlt(t))) # [1] &quot;sec&quot; &quot;min&quot; &quot;hour&quot; &quot;mday&quot; &quot;mon&quot; &quot;year&quot; &quot;wday&quot; &quot;yday&quot; &quot;isdst&quot; unclass(as.POSIXlt(t))$hour # [1] 1 8.2.3 Time zones Time zones can be seen as local modifiers of time: where time as numeric value is stored with respect to UTC (universal coordinated time), a local time zone is used to format it, and a time zone can be specified for creation, and formatting: (t = as.POSIXct(&quot;1970-01-01 00:00:00&quot;, tz = &quot;PST&quot;)) # [1] &quot;1970-01-01 PST&quot; this adds a time zone modifier to t that redefines the time origin, as as.numeric(t) # [1] 0 To convert POSIXt to Date we can use as.Date; this converts to the local date. Converting back to POSIXct looses the time of day and time zone information. (t = as.POSIXct(&quot;1970-01-01 23:00:00&quot;, tz = &quot;PST&quot;)) # [1] &quot;1970-01-01 23:00:00 PST&quot; as.Date(t) # [1] &quot;1970-01-01&quot; format(as.POSIXct(as.Date(t)), tz = &quot;UTC&quot;) # [1] &quot;1970-01-01&quot; Working with local time zones is sometimes confusing when the data we work with were not referenced to this time zone. It may help to set Sys.setenv(TZ=&quot;UTC&quot;) at the start of an R script. The effect is, at lease on some platforms, that R thinks it is working in a UTC time zone. This way, the scripts will produce identical outputs, no matter in which time zone it is run. 8.3 Coordinate Reference Systems We follow Lott (2015) when defining the following concepts (italics indicate literal quoting): a coordinate system is a set of mathematical rules for specifying how coordinates are to be assigned to points a datum is a parameter or set of parameters that define the position of the origin, the scale, and the orientation of a coordinate system, a geodetic datum is a datum describing the relationship of a two- or three-dimensional coordinate system to the Earth, and a coordinate reference system is a coordinate system that is related to an object by a datum; for geodetic and vertical datums, the object will be the Earth. A readable text that further explains these concepts is Iliffe and Lott (2008). Essentially it boils down to the Earth not following a regular shape. The topography of the Earth is of course known to vary strongly, but also the surface formed by constant gravity at mean sea level, the geoid, is irregular. A commonly used model that is fit to the geoid is an ellipsoid of revolution, which is an ellipse with two identical minor axes. This model can be fit locally to be highly precise, can be fixed for particular tectonic plates (like ETRS89), or can be globally fit (like WGS84). The definitions above state that coordinates in degrees longitude and latitude can only have a meaning, i.e. can only be understood as Earth coordinates when the datum they relate to is given. Recomputing coordinates in a new datum is called coordinate transformation. 8.3.1 Projections When we look at geographical data on a paper map or a screen, or on any flat device, we see the values projected – they are no longer arranged on an a sphere or ellipsoid. Even if we plot degrees longitude/latitude data on a flat x/y plane with unit aspect ratio, we use a projection, called plate carrée. Note that even for projected data, the data that were projected are associated with a reference ellipsoid (datum). Going from one projection to the other without changing datum is called coordinate conversion, and usually passes through the geographic coordinates of the datum involved; up to numerical errors this process is lossless and invertible. 8.3.2 Describing Coordinate Reference Systems Lott (2015) describes a standard for encoding coordinate reference system using well known text; the standard is referred to as WKT2. GDAL and PROJ support this encoding (FIXME: verify this is true by the time this book goes into print). Traditionally, PROJ used a string representation to encode coordinate reference systems (datums) and projections, called the proj4string. Some of these come from a catalogue (originally) compiled by the European Petroleum Survey Group (now: International Association of Oil &amp; Gas Producers), and have a so-called epsg code. Package sf provides a crs class which is initialised either by an epsg code, like st_crs(4326) # Coordinate Reference System: # User input: EPSG:4326 # wkt: # GEOGCRS[&quot;WGS 84&quot;, # DATUM[&quot;World Geodetic System 1984&quot;, # ELLIPSOID[&quot;WGS 84&quot;,6378137,298.257223563, # LENGTHUNIT[&quot;metre&quot;,1]]], # PRIMEM[&quot;Greenwich&quot;,0, # ANGLEUNIT[&quot;degree&quot;,0.0174532925199433]], # CS[ellipsoidal,2], # AXIS[&quot;geodetic latitude (Lat)&quot;,north, # ORDER[1], # ANGLEUNIT[&quot;degree&quot;,0.0174532925199433]], # AXIS[&quot;geodetic longitude (Lon)&quot;,east, # ORDER[2], # ANGLEUNIT[&quot;degree&quot;,0.0174532925199433]], # USAGE[ # SCOPE[&quot;Horizontal component of 3D system.&quot;], # AREA[&quot;World.&quot;], # BBOX[-90,-180,90,180]], # ID[&quot;EPSG&quot;,4326]] or by a PROJ string, like st_crs(&quot;+proj=longlat&quot;) # Coordinate Reference System: # User input: +proj=longlat # wkt: # GEOGCRS[&quot;unknown&quot;, # DATUM[&quot;World Geodetic System 1984&quot;, # ELLIPSOID[&quot;WGS 84&quot;,6378137,298.257223563, # LENGTHUNIT[&quot;metre&quot;,1]], # ID[&quot;EPSG&quot;,6326]], # PRIMEM[&quot;Greenwich&quot;,0, # ANGLEUNIT[&quot;degree&quot;,0.0174532925199433], # ID[&quot;EPSG&quot;,8901]], # CS[ellipsoidal,2], # AXIS[&quot;longitude&quot;,east, # ORDER[1], # ANGLEUNIT[&quot;degree&quot;,0.0174532925199433, # ID[&quot;EPSG&quot;,9122]]], # AXIS[&quot;latitude&quot;,north, # ORDER[2], # ANGLEUNIT[&quot;degree&quot;,0.0174532925199433, # ID[&quot;EPSG&quot;,9122]]]] and can be missing valued st_crs() # Coordinate Reference System: NA A number of methods are available for crs objects: methods(class = &quot;crs&quot;) # [1] $ coerce format initialize is.na Ops # [7] print show slotsFromS3 st_as_text st_crs # see &#39;?methods&#39; for accessing help and source code The Ops methods are convenience functions, e.g. st_crs(4326) == st_crs(&quot;+proj=longlat&quot;) # [1] TRUE but there not all cases semantically identical crs objects will yield equality in this test. st_as_text converts a crs object into WKT, we print it using cat: cat(st_as_text(st_crs(4326), pretty = TRUE)) # GEOGCS[&quot;WGS 84&quot;, # DATUM[&quot;WGS_1984&quot;, # SPHEROID[&quot;WGS 84&quot;,6378137,298.257223563]], # PRIMEM[&quot;Greenwich&quot;,0], # UNIT[&quot;degree&quot;,0.0174532925199433, # AUTHORITY[&quot;EPSG&quot;,&quot;9122&quot;]], # AXIS[&quot;Latitude&quot;,NORTH], # AXIS[&quot;Longitude&quot;,EAST], # AUTHORITY[&quot;EPSG&quot;,&quot;4326&quot;]] It should be noted that at the time of writing this, a new draft standard for WKT (informally called WKT2, Lott (2015)) is rapidly being implemented in GDAL and PROJ, and can be expected in R once these changes appear in released versions. st_crs is also a generic, with methods for methods(st_crs) # [1] st_crs.bbox* st_crs.character* st_crs.crs* st_crs.CRS* # [5] st_crs.default* st_crs.dimensions* st_crs.numeric* st_crs.Raster* # [9] st_crs.sf* st_crs.sfc* st_crs.Spatial* st_crs.SpatRaster* # [13] st_crs.stars* # see &#39;?methods&#39; for accessing help and source code The method for sfc objects can drill further into the underlying data, by adding an argument; a few of these are printed by st_crs(st_sfc(crs = 4326), parameters = TRUE)[c(1:4, 8)] # $SemiMajor # 6378137 [m] # # $SemiMinor # 6356752 [m] # # $InvFlattening # [1] 298 # # $IsGeographic # [1] TRUE # # $Wkt # [1] &quot;GEOGCS[\\&quot;WGS 84\\&quot;,DATUM[\\&quot;WGS_1984\\&quot;,SPHEROID[\\&quot;WGS 84\\&quot;,6378137,298.257223563]],PRIMEM[\\&quot;Greenwich\\&quot;,0],UNIT[\\&quot;degree\\&quot;,0.0174532925199433,AUTHORITY[\\&quot;EPSG\\&quot;,\\&quot;9122\\&quot;]],AXIS[\\&quot;Latitude\\&quot;,NORTH],AXIS[\\&quot;Longitude\\&quot;,EAST],AUTHORITY[\\&quot;EPSG\\&quot;,\\&quot;4326\\&quot;]]&quot; where we see that udunits and GDAL units are integrated. The major axis lengths (SemiMajor) and inverse flattening are used e.g. to compute great circle distances on the ellipsoid, using the algorithm from Karney (2013). This algorithm is implemented in PROJ, and interfaced by lwgeom::st_geod_distance, which is called from sf::st_distance when objects have geographic coordinates.

Two recent books on visualisation (Healy 2018, @Wilke) contain chapters on visualising geospatial data or maps. Here, we will not try to preach the do’s and don’ts of maps, but rather point out a number of possibilities how to do things, point out challenges along the way and ways to mitigate them. 9.1 Every plot is a projection The world is round, but plotting devices are flat. As mentioned in section 8.3.1, any time we visualise, in any way, the world on a flat device, we project: we convert angular, geographic coordinates into Cartesian coordinates. This includes the cases where we think we “do nothing” (figure 9.1, left), or where show the world “as it is”, e.g. as seen from space (figure 9.1, right). Figure 9.1: Earth country boundaries; left: mapping long/lat to x and y; right: as seen from space The left plot of figure 9.1 was obtained by library(sf) library(rnaturalearth) w &lt;- ne_countries(scale = &quot;medium&quot;, returnclass = &quot;sf&quot;) plot(st_geometry(w)) and we see that this is the default projection for data with geographic coordinates, as indicated by st_crs(w) # Coordinate Reference System: # User input: EPSG:4326 # wkt: # GEOGCRS[&quot;WGS 84&quot;, # DATUM[&quot;World Geodetic System 1984&quot;, # ELLIPSOID[&quot;WGS 84&quot;,6378137,298.257223563, # LENGTHUNIT[&quot;metre&quot;,1]]], # PRIMEM[&quot;Greenwich&quot;,0, # ANGLEUNIT[&quot;degree&quot;,0.0174532925199433]], # CS[ellipsoidal,2], # AXIS[&quot;geodetic latitude (Lat)&quot;,north, # ORDER[1], # ANGLEUNIT[&quot;degree&quot;,0.0174532925199433]], # AXIS[&quot;geodetic longitude (Lon)&quot;,east, # ORDER[2], # ANGLEUNIT[&quot;degree&quot;,0.0174532925199433]], # USAGE[ # SCOPE[&quot;Horizontal component of 3D system.&quot;], # AREA[&quot;World.&quot;], # BBOX[-90,-180,90,180]], # ID[&quot;EPSG&quot;,4326]] The projection taken here is the equirectangular (or equidistant cylindrical) projection, which maps longitude and latitude linear to the x and y axis, keeping an aspect ratio of 1. Were we to do this for smaller areas not on the equator, it makes sense to choose a plot ratio such that one distance unit E-W equals one distance unit N-S on the center of the plotted area. We can also carry out this projection before plotting. Say we want to do this for Germany, then after loading the (rough) country outline, we use st_transform to project: DE = st_geometry(ne_countries(country = &quot;germany&quot;, returnclass = &quot;sf&quot;)) DE.eqc = st_transform(DE, &quot;+proj=eqc +lat_ts=51.14 +lon_0=90w&quot;) st_transform takes an sf or sfc object, and as second argument the projection. This can either be a number of a known EPSG projection, e.g. listed at http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/ , or a string describing the projection (+proj=...) with further parameters. The parameter here is lat_ts, the latitude of true scale (i.e., one length unit N-S equals one length unit E-W), which was here chosen as the middle of the bounding box latitudes mean(st_bbox(DE)[c(&quot;ymin&quot;, &quot;ymax&quot;)]) # [1] 51.1 When we now plot both maps (figure 9.2), they look the same up to their values along the axes: degrees for geographic (left), and metres for Cartesian coordinates. par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) plot(DE, axes = TRUE) plot(DE.eqc, axes = TRUE) Figure 9.2: Germany in equidistant cylindrical projection: left with degrees, right with metres along the axes 9.1.1 What is a good projection for my data? There is unfortunately no silver bullet here. Projections that maintain all distances do not exist; only globes do. The most used projections try to preserve areas (equal area), directions (conformal, e.g. Mercator), some properties of distances (e.g. equirectangular preserves distances along meridians, azimuthal equidistant preserves distances to a central point) or some compromise of these. Parameters of projections decide what is shown in the center of a map and what on the fringes, which areas are up and which are down, and which areas are most enlarged. All these choices are in the end political decisions. It is often entertaining and at times educational to play around with the different projections and understand their consequences. When the primary purpose of the map however is not to entertain or educate projection varieties, it may be preferrable to choose a well-known or less surprising projection, and move the discussion which projection should be preferred to a decision process on its own. 9.1.2 Does projection always work? No. Look for instance at the figure 9.1, right. Countries like the USA are half out-of-sight. Where is the California coast line drawn? The PROJ string used here was \"+proj=ortho +lat_0=30 +lon_0=-10\" and we can easily check what happens to a polygon that crosses the visible area by setting both parameters to 0: sq = rbind(c(-89,0), c(-89,1), c(-91,1), c(-91,0), c(-89,0)) pol = st_sfc(st_polygon(list(sq)), crs = 4326) (pol.o = st_transform(pol, &quot;+proj=ortho +lat_0=0 +lon_0=0&quot;))[[1]] # POLYGON ((-6377166 0, -6376201 110569, -6377166 0)) st_is_valid(pol.o, NA_on_exception=FALSE) # Error in CPL_geos_is_valid(x, as.logical(NA_on_exception)): Evaluation error: IllegalArgumentException: Invalid number of points in LinearRing found 3 - must be 0 or &gt;= 4. where we see that the polygon is not nicely cut along the visibility line, but that the invisible points are simply dropped. This leads in this case to an invalid geometry, and may in the case of 9.1 lead to straight lines that do not follow the map border circle. How was figure 9.1 created? By using a rather ugly script that used a projected half-sphere circle to first cooky-cut the part of the countries that would remain visible on this projection. The script is available, and so is its output. 9.2 Plotting points, lines, polygons, grid cells Since maps are just a special form of plots of statistical data, the usual rules hold. Frequently occuring challenges include: polygons may be very small, and vanish when plotted depending on the data, polygons for different features may well overlap, and be visible only partially; using transparent fill colors may help indentify them when points are plotted with symbols, they may easily overlap and be hidden; density maps (chapter 13) may be more helpful lines may be hard to read when coloured and may overlap regardless line width When plotting polygons filled with colors, one has the choice to plot polygon boundaries, or to suppress these. If polygon boundaries draw too much attention, an alternative is to colour them in a grey tone, or another color that doesn’t interfere with the fill colors. When suppressing boundaries entirely, polygons with (nearly) identical colors will melt together. If the property indicating the fill color is constant over the region, such as land cover type, this is OK. If the property is an aggregation, the region over which it was aggregated gets lost. Especially for extensive variables, e.g. the amount of people living in a polygon, this strongly misleads. But even with polygon boundaries, using filled polygons for such variables may not be a good idea. The use of continuous color scales for continuously varying variables may look attractive, but is often more fancy than useful: it impracticle to match a color on the map with a legend value colors ramps often stretch non-linearly over the value range Only for cases where the identification of values is less important than the continuity of the map, such as the coloring of a high resolution digital terrain model, it does serve its goal. 9.3 Color palettes and class intervals FIXME: discuss color palettes, continuous/categorical, diverging, RColorBrewer, viridis, … When plotting continuous geometry attributes using a limited set of colors (or symbols), classes need to be made from the data. The R package classInt (R. Bivand 2020a) provides a number of methods to do so. Using it is quite simple: library(classInt) # set.seed(1) needed ? r = rnorm(100) (cI &lt;- classIntervals(r)) # style: quantile # one of 1.49e+10 possible partitions of this variable into 8 classes # [-2.61,-1.26) [-1.26,-0.356) [-0.356,-0.131) [-0.131,0.091) [0.091,0.433) # 13 12 13 12 12 # [0.433,0.623) [0.623,1.11) [1.11,2.76] # 13 12 13 cI$brks # [1] -2.612 -1.257 -0.356 -0.131 0.091 0.433 0.623 1.113 2.755 and it takes argument n for the number of intervals, and a style that can be one of “fixed”, “sd”, “equal”, “pretty”, “quantile”, “kmeans”, “hclust”, “bclust”, “fisher” or “jenks”. Style “pretty” may not obey n; if n is missing, ‘nclass.Sturges’ is used; two other methods are available for choosing n automatically. If the number of observations is greater than 3000, a 10% sample is used to create the breaks for “fisher” and “jenks”. 9.4 Poles and datelines Given the linestring (ls = st_sfc(st_linestring(rbind(c(-179.5, 52), c(179.5, 52))), crs = 4326)) # Geometry set for 1 feature # geometry type: LINESTRING # dimension: XY # bbox: xmin: -180 ymin: 52 xmax: 180 ymax: 52 # geographic CRS: WGS 84 # LINESTRING (-180 52, 180 52) How long a distance does it span? Let’s see: st_length(ls) # 68677 [m] which seems sensible. But does ls actually intersect with the dateline? dateline = st_sfc(st_linestring(rbind(c(180, 51), c(180, 53))), crs = 4326) st_intersects(ls, dateline) # although coordinates are longitude/latitude, st_intersects assumes that they are planar # Sparse geometry binary predicate list of length 1, where the predicate was `intersects&#39; # 1: (empty) … it seems not? How can this be? The warning said it all: if ls is not in spherical coordinates, it means it follows the 52th parallel, crossing (0, 52) half way. This is as if we drew a straight line between the two points on the left figure of 9.1, almost across the complete 52N parallel. Where do these inconsistencies come from? The software sf is built upon (see the C/C++ libraries box in figure 1.6) is a GIS software stack that originally targeted flat, 2D geometries. The simple feature standard assumes straight lines between points, but great circle segments are not straight. The functions that deal with spherical geometry, such as st_length, use PostGIS extensions in liblwgeom that were added later on to PostGIS, without rewriting the entire geometry core for geographic coordinates. More recent systems, including Google’s S21, BigQuery GIS2 and Ubers H33 were written from scratch with global data in mind, and work exclusively with geographic coordinates. 9.4.1 st_wrap_dateline The st_wrap_dateline function can be convenient, (ls.w = st_wrap_dateline(ls))[[1]] # MULTILINESTRING ((-180 52, -180 52), (180 52, 180 52)) as it cuts any geometry crossing the dateline into MULTI-geometries of which the sub-geometries touch on, but no longer cross the dateline. This is in particular convenient for plotting geographic coordinates using naive approaches such as that of figure 9.1 left, where they would have crossed the entire plotting area. Note that by cutting the line at (180,52), st_wrap_dateline does not follow a great circle; for this, it should be preceded by st_segmentize, as e.g. in (ls.w2 = st_wrap_dateline(st_segmentize(ls, units::set_units(30, km))))[[1]] # MULTILINESTRING ((-180 52, -180 52, -180 52, -180 52), (180 52, 180 52, 180 52)) Also note that bounding boxes like st_bbox(ls.w) # xmin ymin xmax ymax # -180 52 180 52 simply take the coordinate ranges, and are pretty much meaningless as descriptors of the extent of a geometry for geometries that cross the dateline. Similar notions hold for the poles; a polygon enclosing the North pole pole = st_sfc(st_polygon(list(rbind(c(0,80), c(120,80), c(240,80), c(0,80)))), crs = 4326) does not include the pole st_intersects(pole, st_sfc(st_point(c(0,90)), crs = 4326)) # although coordinates are longitude/latitude, st_intersects assumes that they are planar # Sparse geometry binary predicate list of length 1, where the predicate was `intersects&#39; # 1: (empty) (Cartesian interpretation) but has a positive area st_area(pole) # 1.63e+12 [m^2] indicating again a geographic interpretation. 9.5 Graticules and other navigation aids Graticules are lines on a map that follow constant latitude or longitude values. On figure 9.1 left they are drawn in grey. Graticules are often drawn in maps to give reference where something is. In our first map in figure 1.1 we can read that the area plotted is near 35\\(^o\\) North and 80\\(^o\\) West. Had we plotted the lines in the projected coordinate system, they would have been straight and their actual numbers would not have been very informative, apart from giving an interpretation of size or distances when the unit is known, and familiar to the map reader. Graticules, by that, also shed light on which projection was used: equirectangular or Mercator projections will have straight vertical and horizontal lines, conic projections have straight but diverging meridians, equal area may have curved meridians The real navigation aid on figure 9.1 and most other maps are geographical features like the state outline, country outlines, coast lines, rivers, roads, railways and so on. If these are added sparsely and sufficiently, graticules can as well be omitted. In such cases, maps look good without axes, tics, and labels, leaving up a lot of plotting space to be filled with actual map data.

Higher-level plots created with ggplot2, which are built on top of the grid package, are discussed in chapter 11. 10.1 Base plots The nice thing about base plots is that they work relatively simply, and can be built incrementally: after plotting a first element, it is possible to add further elements — like titles, axes, legends, annotations — with additional function calls. Making more complex plots such as faceted plots is more of a challenge with base plot. They may also be faster than e.g. ggplot2. This chapter focuses on the base plot methods for sf and stars objects, and in particular where they deviate from what one expects from base R plots: default colors, color key placement, and multiple maps. 10.1.1 plot.sf defaults When we plot an sf object with multiple attributes, we get to see multiple attributes, as shown in figure 10.1; the warning indicates that the number of attributes plotted has been limited (by the argument max.plot), that by default no key is shown when multiple attributes are plotted, and that factor or character columns are plotted with a categorical scale, and numeric variables by a continuous color scale. system.file(&quot;gpkg/nc.gpkg&quot;, package=&quot;sf&quot;) %&gt;% read_sf -&gt; nc plot(nc) # Warning: plotting the first 10 out of 14 attributes; use max.plot = 14 to plot # all Figure 10.1: default plot with multiple attributes When the attributes values have a common reference system it makes sense to plot a key, and this can be done by suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr)) nc %&gt;% select(SID74, SID79) %&gt;% plot(key.pos = 4) # 1: below; 4: right Figure 10.2: two attributes sharing a key 10.1.2 Controlling color, color breaks, key The color of each feature geometry, be it a point, line or polygon, can be controlled by passing a single value to argument col, or to pass a vector with colors of length equal to the number of features. In that case, one does not get an automatic key, since the mapping of values to the key is unclear. One can get further control over the key by specifying either of breaks, to one of the classInt::classIntervals styles (“fixed”, “sd”, “equal”, “pretty”, “quantile”, “kmeans”, “hclust”, “bclust”, “fisher”, or “jenks”), or to the numeric vector of (increasing) class break values, nbreaks to set the number of color breaks, and pal, to pass a function that generates a palette, e.g. rainbow or viridis::viridis. logz which causes legend values to be plotted as 10-powers at which controls the values plotted along the key key.pos plots the key beneath (1), left (2), over (3) or to the right (4) of the map(s), and is omitted if NULL. An example is shown in figure 10.3. plot(nc[&quot;SID74&quot;], logz = TRUE, pal = viridis::viridis, breaks = c(0,.5,1,1.5,2,2.5), at = c(0,.5,1,1.5,2,2.5), key.width = lcm(1.3), key.length = 1) Figure 10.3: controlling key color and breaks; log transform causes zero values to remain uncolored; custom key size parameters For factor variables, the key shows factor levels, and key.length and/or key.width may need to be further controlled to get them look good. 10.1.3 Incrementally adding plot elements We can add elements to maps without keys by simply adding add = TRUE. When a map has a key, the initial plot command needs to have reset = FALSE. The reason for this is as follows. When plotting a map with a key on the side, in base plot one needs to cut up the plotting region in a region for the map, and a region for the key, similar to using par(mfrow = c(1,2)). In order to not keep the plot region splitting active for subsequent, unrelated plots, it is removed before the plot function returns. This means that by default one cannot add elements to a plot. In case we want to add elements to a plot, we need to instruct plot not to reset, and then can add elements if we set add = TRUE, as shown in figure 10.4. plot(nc[&quot;SID74&quot;], pal = viridis::viridis, reset = FALSE, graticule = TRUE, axes = TRUE) plot(st_point(c(-81.498,36.434)), col = &#39;red&#39;, pch = 1, cex = 4, lwd = 3, add = TRUE) layout(matrix(1)) # manually reset the plotting region split-up Figure 10.4: adding plot elements to a map with a key; graticule and axes 10.1.4 plotting graticules and axes A graticule (section 9.5) is added if graticule = TRUE is set; figure 10.4 gives an example. Axes are by default omitted: they take space, and often other map elements, such as boundaries or coast lines, are sufficient for orientation. Axes can be added with axes = TRUE. They are given in values of the coordinate reference system of the data, unless a graticule is added, in which case they correspond to the graticule values. 10.1.5 plot.stars defaults The base plot method for stars objects follows a number of parameters that were also discussed above for plot.sf. These are: key.pos, logz, axes, reset, key.width, key.length nbreaks, and breaks. The default for breaks is \"quantile\"; along with the default join_zlim = TRUE this results in quantile values taken from all of the images shown in a composite plot to yeild color breaks. The result of this is shown in figure 6.1, the default stars plot for a multi-band raster. If join_zlim is FALSE, color breaks are computed separately for each subplot, and a joint legend is not possible, hence, no legend is drawn. For large datasets with more than 10000 pixels, a (regular) sample of size 10000 is taken to determine quantiles, rather than using the entire dataset. The col argument provides the pallette used, and not a color vector for each pixel; by default a linear grey scale is used. box_col is the color used for the boxes around subplots. With the default of downsample = TRUE, plot.stars does not plot many more pixels than can be seen on the plotting device. As shown in the left subfigure of 6.2, the rgb parameter can be used to specify three bands for creating rgb colors. maxColorValue, by default the maximum of all bands, can be used to specify the maximum pixel values for scaling pixel values into rgb components. The effect of setting text_values and interpolate are shown in figure 10.5 showing a 10 x 10 cell raster. text_values prints cell values as text, e.g. for numeric examples. interpolate interpolates rgb values, and seems to limit its extent to the raster cell centres, rather than corners. tif = system.file(&quot;tif/L7_ETMs.tif&quot;, package = &quot;stars&quot;) library(stars) x = read_stars(tif) par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) plot(x[,1:10,1:10,1], text_values=TRUE, key.pos = NULL, col = viridis::viridis(10), reset = FALSE) plot(x[,1:10,1:10,1:3], rgb=1:3, interpolate = TRUE, reset = FALSE) Figure 10.5: stars plots with text values (left) and interpolated rgb colors (right); both maps plot a 10 x 10 raster Some rasters cannot be plotted by R’s image, but have to be plotted as features (polygons or points); examples are rotated, sheared and curvilinear grids. Figure 10.6 shows a sheared grid, and illustrates st_as_sf for conversion to simple features, merge for whether to merge polygons with identical values, and as_points to plot raster cells as points. par(mfrow = c(1, 3)) xs = adrop(x[,1:10,1:10,1]) attr(attr(xs, &quot;dimensions&quot;), &quot;raster&quot;)$affine = c(1, 3) plot(xs, col = viridis::viridis(10), key.pos = NULL, reset = FALSE) plot(st_as_sf(xs, as_points = FALSE, merge = FALSE), pal = viridis::viridis, key.pos = NULL, reset = FALSE) plot(st_as_sf(xs, as_points = TRUE, merge = FALSE), key.pos = NULL, pal = viridis::viridis, pch = 16, reset = FALSE) Figure 10.6: sheared rasters, plotted as simple features; left: with merged polygon features, middle: with seperate polygons, right: as point features 10.2 Combining base plots Figure 10.6 is an exmaple of multiple plots of stars and sf objects in one plot. They could be combined because they lack the automatic legend key. The explanation about the need for parameter reset and the examples above with multiple subplots setting it to FALSE already show the limitations of this approach: if we want a key next to each map, we cannot easily combine maps in subplots, using sf‘s or stars’ plot methods. If we can do without the automatic legend, all is fine. A more flexible approach to combine maps and map elements into a composite is using package grid as shown in the next section, or ggplot facet plots (which also use grid) as will be shown in chapter 11 about ggplot2. 10.3 Grid plots and viewports Package grid, one of the R base packages, takes a more structured approach to building plots than base plot does. It allows the creation of graphic objects (objects of class grob, or grobs) that contain all the information for plotting, and the definition of viewports, plotting subregions within which coordinate systems can easily be redefined. Packages like ggplot2 (chapter 11) and lattice are built upon the logic provided by grid. Package sf contains st_as_grob methods for all feature geometry classes. Figure 10.7 shows a simple plot of all the nc counties drawn using grid functions. library(grid) system.file(&quot;gpkg/nc.gpkg&quot;, package=&quot;sf&quot;) %&gt;% read_sf -&gt; nc st_viewport(nc) %&gt;% pushViewport st_geometry(nc) %&gt;% lapply(st_as_grob) %&gt;% lapply(grid.draw) -&gt; x Figure 10.7: simple plot created with grid functions The st_as_grob methods are exported by sf and used by ggplot2::geom_sf to convert geometries into plot-able objects; this way, ggplot2 needs no knowledge on how geometries are stored in R objects. "],["ggplot2.html", "Chapter 11 ggplot2 11.1 geom_sf 11.2 geom_stars", " Chapter 11 ggplot2 Function ggplot from package ggplot2 (Wickham 2016) provides a high-level interface to creating graphs, essentially by composing all their ingredients and constraints in a single expression. It implements the “grammar for graphics” by Wilkinson (2006), and is the plotting package of choice in the tidyverse. Before ggplot 3.0.0 came out, the approach to plotting spatial data was to fortify it, meaning encode all the geometries as atomic vectors in a data.frame, keeping an ID column to register which coordinate belonged to which geometry, and repeating all non-geometry attributes for each geometry coordinate. This worked reasonably well for points and lines, but not very well for polygons with holes. Since ggplot 3.0.0 and package sf, this runs much smoother; ggplot has received a geom_sf function that could take an sf object and calls st_as_grob on each feature geometry to get an object that can directly be added to the plot. In addition to that, it takes care of automated datum transformations or projections if different objects have differing coordinate reference systems, and adds by default a graticule and degree axis tic labels. Moreno and Basille (n.d.a), Moreno and Basille (n.d.b) and Moreno and Basille (n.d.c) published three guest blogs on r-spatial.org explaining the capabilities of ggplot for making beautiful maps with sf and ggplot2. 11.1 geom_sf We will introduce the properties of geom_sf here step by step. We use a projected version of nc library(tidyverse) library(sf) system.file(&quot;gpkg/nc.gpkg&quot;, package=&quot;sf&quot;) %&gt;% read_sf() %&gt;% st_transform(32119) -&gt; nc.32119 and create a first ggplot by ggplot() + geom_sf(data = nc.32119) It is attractive to think that ggplot(nc.32119) + geom_sf() would also work, but it doesn’t – it only works if the geometry column is named geometry, which is not always the case (sf objects may have more than one geometry column). If we want to get rid of the axis tics and grid lines, we could use ggplot() + geom_sf(data = nc.32119) + theme_void() + theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(color = &quot;white&quot;)) A simple ggplot2 plot with polygons colored by attributes is created by ggplot() + geom_sf(data = nc.32119) + aes(fill = BIR74) + scale_fill_gradientn(colors = viridis::viridis(20)) 11.1.1 facet plots Facet plots are a powerful means to compare maps, because they keep all the plotting parameters constant (spatial extent, scale, color breaks). One would perhaps wish that it were possible to directly plot multiple attribute columns over facet maps. For this, we first have to reorganise the data such that the target variable is a single column, another column indicates the facet, and geometries are repeated accordingly. For this, tidyr::gather can be used; an example is given in figure 1.2. 11.1.2 multiple geometries in a single map Multiple geometries with geom_sf can be created by adding consecutive geom_sf geometries; we can add for instance the county centroids to a plot by ggplot() + geom_sf(data = nc.32119) + geom_sf(data = st_centroid(nc.32119)) # Warning in st_centroid.sf(nc.32119): st_centroid assumes attributes are constant # over geometries of x When subsequent sf objects have a different coordinate reference system from the first object, geom_sf will transform them to the reference system of the first object. 11.1.3 Fine tuning In case sf objects have multiple geometry list-columns, the “active” list column is selected by default. This can be overriden by supplying another column name in aes(geometry = my_column) ` To add labels to geometries, one can use geom_sf_label. From the examples of geom_sf: nc &lt;- sf::st_read(system.file(&quot;gpkg/nc.gpkg&quot;, package = &quot;sf&quot;), quiet = TRUE) nc_3857 &lt;- sf::st_transform(nc, &quot;+init=epsg:3857&quot;) # Warning in CPL_crs_from_input(x): GDAL Message 1: +init=epsg:XXXX syntax is # deprecated. It might return a CRS with a non-EPSG compliant axis order. ggplot() + geom_sf(data = nc_3857[1:3, ], aes(fill = AREA)) + geom_sf_label(data = nc_3857[1:3, ], aes(label = NAME)) geom_sf_text can be used to add simple text annotations without decoration. Graticules are drawn by default. Since they are different for every projection, it is hard to anticipate how strongly they will be curved. geom_sf takes a parameter ndiscr, by default set to 100, which can be increased when graticulas show up unexpectedly as non-smooth lines. label_graticules can be used to control which graticules are labeled. In addition, label_axes controls on which axes particular graticules will be labeled. 11.2 geom_stars Package stars comes with a geom_stars function that is much more limited in scope than geom_sf. In essence, it creates a call to geom_raster in case of raster data with a regular grid, to geom_tile for other raster data, or to geom_sf if the stars object has a simple feature geometry dimension rather than raster dimensions, or has a curvilinear raster geom_raster also creates the mapping of dimension names to x and y-coordinates and set the first attribute name as the fill variable. This means that the aspect ratio still needs to be controlled (coord_equal()) and that a facet_wrap is needed to display multiple rasters. An example is shown in figure 11.1. library(stars) library(ggplot2) library(viridis) # Loading required package: viridisLite system.file(&quot;tif/L7_ETMs.tif&quot;, package = &quot;stars&quot;) %&gt;% read_stars() -&gt; x g = ggplot() + coord_equal() + scale_fill_viridis() + theme_void() + scale_x_discrete(expand=c(0,0)) + scale_y_discrete(expand=c(0,0)) g + geom_stars(data = x) + facet_wrap(~band) Figure 11.1: example of geom_stars geom_stars has a parameter, downsample, which can be used to downsample particular dimensions.

The boundaries may be those of administrative entities, and may be related to underlying spatial processes, such as commuting flows, but are usually arbitrary. If they do not match the underlying and unobserved spatial processes in one or more variables of interest, proximate areal units will contain parts of the underlying processes, engendering spatial autocorrelation. This is at least in part because the aggregated observations are driven by autocorrelated factors which may or may not themselves have been observed. With support of data we mean the physical size (lenth, area, volume) associated with an individual observational unit (measurement). It is possible to represent the support of areal data by a point, despite the fact that the data have polygonal support. The centroid of the polygon may be taken as a representative point, or the centroid of the largest polygon in a multi-polygon object. When data with intrinsic point support are treated as areal data, the change of support goes the other way, from the known point to a non-overlapping tesselation such as a Voronoi diagram or Dirichlet tessellation or Thiessen polygons often through a Delaunay triangulation and using a Euclidean plane (projected coordinates). Here, different metrics may also be chosen, or distances measured on a network rather than on the plane. There is also a literature using weighted Voronoi diagrams in local spatial analysis (see for example Boots and Okabe 2007; Okabe et al. 2008; She et al. 2015). When the intrinsic support of the data is as points, but the underlying process is between proximate observations rather than driven chiefly by distance however measured between observations, the data may be aggregate counts or totals (polling stations, retail turnover) or represent a directly observed characteristic of the observation (opening hours of the polling station). Obviously, the risk of mis-representing the footprint of the underlying spatial processes remains in all of these cases, not least because the observations are taken as encompassing the entirety of the underlying process in the case of tesselation of the whole area of interest. This is distinct from the geostatistical setting in which observations are rather samples taken using some scheme within the area of interest. It is also partly distinct from the practice of taking areal sample plots within the area of interest but covering only a small proportion of the area, typically used in ecological and environmental research. This chapter then considers a subset of the methods potentially available for exploring spatial autocorrelation in areal data, or data being handled as areal, where the spatial processes are considered as working through proximity understood in the first instance as contiguity, as a graph linking observations taken as neighbours. This graph is typically undirected and unweighted, but may be directed and/or weighted in certain settings, which then leads to further issues with regard to symmetry. In principle, proximity would be expected to operate symmetrically in space, that is that the influence of \\(i\\) on \\(j\\) and of \\(j\\) on \\(i\\) based on their relative positions should be equivalent. Edge effects are not considered in standard treatments. 15.1 Spatial autocorrelation When analysing areal data, it has long been recognised that, if present, spatial autocorrelation changes how we may infer, relative to the default position of independent observations. In the presence of spatial autocorrelation, we can predict the values of observation \\(i\\) from the values observed at \\(j \\in N_i\\), the set of its proximate neighbours. Early results (Moran 1948; Geary 1954), entered into research practice gradually, for example the social sciences (Duncan, Cuzzort, and Duncan 1961). These results were then collated and extended to yield a set of basic tools of analysis (Cliff and Ord 1973, 1981). Cliff and Ord (1973) generalised and extended the expression of the spatial weights matrix representation as part of the framework for establishing the distribution theory for join count, Moran’s \\(I\\) and Geary’s \\(C\\) statistics. This development of what have become known as global measures, returning a single value of autocorrelation for the total study area, has been supplemented by local measures returning values for each areal unit (Getis and Ord 1992; Anselin 1995). 15.2 Spatial weight matrices Handling spatial autocorrelation using relationships to neighbours on a graph takes the graph as given, chosen by the analyst. This differs from the geostatistical approach in which the analyst chooses the binning of the empirical variogram and function used, and then the way the fitted variogram is fitted. Both involve a priori choices, but represent the underlying correlation in different ways (Wall 2004). In Bavaud (1998) and work citing his contribution, attempts have been made to place graph-based neighbours in a broader context. One issue arising in the creation of objects representing neighbourhood relationships is that of no-neighbour areal units (Bivand and Portnov 2004). Islands or units separated by rivers may not be recognised as neighbours when the units have areal support and when using topological relationships such as shared boundaries. In some settings, for example mrf (Markov Random Field) terms in mgcv::gam() and similar model fitting functions that require undirected connected graphs, a requirement is violated when there are disconnected subgraphs. No-neighbour observations can also occur when a distance threshold is used between points, where the threshold is smaller than the maximum nearest neighbour distance. Shared boundary contiguities are not affected by using geographical, unprojected coordinates, but all point-based approaches use distance in one way or another, and need to calculate distances in an appropriate way. The spdep package provides an nb class for neighbours, a list of length equal to the number of observations, with integer vector components. No-neighbours are encoded as an integer vector with a single element 0L, and observations with neighbours as sorted integer vectors containing values in 1L:n pointing to the neighbouring observations. This is a typical row-oriented sparse representation of neighbours. spdep provides many ways of constructing nb objects, and the representation and construction functions are widely used in other packages. spdep builds on the nb representation (undirected or directed graphs) with the listw object, a list with three components, an nb object, a matching list of numerical weights, and a single element character vector containing the single letter name of the way in which the weights were calculated. The most frequently used approach in the social sciences is calculating weights by row standardization, so that all the non-zero weights for one observation will be the inverse of the cardinality of its set of neighbours (1/card(nb[[i]])). We will be using election data from the 2015 Polish Presidential election in this chapter, with 2495 municipalities and Warsaw boroughs, and complete count data from polling stations aggregated to these areal units. The data are an sf sf object: library(sf) data(pol_pres15, package=&quot;spDataLarge&quot;) head(pol_pres15[, c(1, 4, 6)]) # Simple feature collection with 6 features and 3 fields # geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON # dimension: XY # bbox: xmin: 235000 ymin: 367000 xmax: 281000 ymax: 413000 # projected CRS: ETRS89 / Poland CS92 # TERYT name types geometry # 1 020101 BOLESŁAWIEC Urban MULTIPOLYGON (((261089 3855... # 2 020102 BOLESŁAWIEC Rural MULTIPOLYGON (((254150 3837... # 3 020103 GROMADKA Rural MULTIPOLYGON (((275346 3846... # 4 020104 NOWOGRODZIEC Urban/rural MULTIPOLYGON (((251770 3770... # 5 020105 OSIECZNICA Rural MULTIPOLYGON (((263424 4060... # 6 020106 WARTA BOLESŁAWIECKA Rural MULTIPOLYGON (((267031 3870... library(tmap) tm_shape(pol_pres15) + tm_fill(&quot;types&quot;) Figure 15.1: Polish municipality types 2015 Between early 2002 and April 2019, spdep contained functions for constructing and handling neighbour and spatial weights objects, tests for spatial autocorrelation, and model fitting functions. The latter have been split out into spatialreg, and will be discussed in the next chapter. spdep now accommodates objects represented using sf classes and sp classes directly, going beyond the explorations made in this vignette. library(spdep) # Loading required package: sp # Loading required package: spData 15.2.1 Contiguous neighbours The poly2nb() function in spdep takes the boundary points making up the polygon boundaries in the object passed as the pl= argument, and for each observation checks whether at least one (queen=TRUE, default), or at least two (rook, queen=FALSE) points are within snap= distance units of each other.

Note that nb objects record both symmetric neighbour relationships, because these objects admit asymmetric relationships as well, but these duplications are not needed for object construction. Most of the spdep functions for constructing neighbour objects take a row.names= argument, the value of which is stored as a region.id attribute. If not given, the values are taken from row.names() of the first argument. These can be used to check that the neighbours object is in the same order as data. If nb objects are subsetted, the indices change to continue to be within 1:length(subsetted_nb), but the region.id attribute values point back to the object from which it was constructed. We can also check that this undirected graph is connected using the n.comp.nb() function: n.comp.nb(nb_q)$nc # [1] 1 Neighbour objects may be exported and imported in GAL format for exchange with other software, using write.nb.gal() and read.gal(): tf &lt;- tempfile(fileext=&quot;.gal&quot;) write.nb.gal(nb_q, tf) Using reticulate, it is possible to interoperate with the PySAL family of Python packages, first libpysal providing the basic weights handling infrastructure. As we can see, the percentage of non-zero neighbours is the same in both software systems. library(reticulate) use_python(python=&#39;/usr/bin/python3&#39;) np &lt;- import(&quot;numpy&quot;) libpysal &lt;- import(&quot;libpysal&quot;) nb_gal_ps &lt;- libpysal$io$open(tf)$read() nb_gal_ps$pct_nonzero # [1] 0.229 15.2.2 Graph-based neighbours If areal units are an appropriate representation, but only points have been observed, contiguity relationships may be approximated using graph-based neighbours. In this case, the imputed boundaries tesselate the plane such that points closer to one observation than any other fall within its polygon. The simplest form is by using triangulation, here using the deldir() function in the deldir package. Because the function returns from and to identifiers, it is easy to construct a long representation of a listw object, as used in the S-Plus SpatialStats module and the sn2listw() function internally to construct an nb object (ragged wide representation). Alternatives often fail to return sufficient information to permit the neighbours to be identified. args(tri2nb) # function (coords, row.names = NULL) # NULL The soi.graph() function takes triangulated neighbours and prunes off neighbour relationships represented by unusually long edges, especially around the convex hull, but may render the output object asymmetric. Other graph-based approaches include relativeneigh() and gabrielneigh(). args(soi.graph) # function (tri.nb, coords, quadsegs = 10) # NULL The output of these functions is then converted to the nb representation using graph2nb(), with the possible use of the sym= argument to coerce to symmetry. args(graph2nb) # function (gob, row.names = NULL, sym = FALSE) # NULL We take the centroids of the largest component polygon for each observation as the point representation; population-weighted centroids might have been a better choice if they were available: coords &lt;- st_centroid(st_geometry(pol_pres15), of_largest_polygon=TRUE) suppressMessages(nb_tri &lt;- tri2nb(coords)) nb_tri # Neighbour list object: # Number of regions: 2495 # Number of nonzero links: 14930 # Percentage nonzero weights: 0.24 # Average number of links: 5.98 The average number of neighbours is similar to the Queen boundary contiguity case, but if we look at the distribution of edge lengths using nbdists(), we can see that although the upper quartile is about 15 km, the maximum is almost 300 km, an edge along much of one side of the convex hull.

For projected coordinates, the RANN package is used to compute nearest neighbours more efficiently.

The nb2listw() function is used to create a listw weights object with an nb object, a matching list of weights vectors, and a style specification. Because handling no-neighbour observations now begins to matter, the zero.policy= argument is introduced. By default, this is FALSE, indicating that no-neighbour observations will cause an error, as the spatially lagged value for an observation with no neighbours is not available. By convention, zero is substituted for the lagged value, as the cross product of a vector of zero-valued weights and a data vector, hence the name of zero.policy. args(nb2listw) # function (neighbours, glist = NULL, style = &quot;W&quot;, zero.policy = NULL) # NULL We will be using the helper function spweights.constants() below to show some consequences of varing style choices. It returns constants for a listw object, \\(n\\) is the number of observations, n1 to n3 are \\(n-1, \\ldots\\), nn is \\(n^2\\) and \\(S_0\\), \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\) are constants, \\(S_0\\) being the sum of the weights.

This style first gives a weight of unity to each neighbour relationship, then divides these weights by the per unit sums of weights. Naturally this leads to division by zero where there are no neighbours, a not-a-number result, unless the chosen policy is to permit no-neighbour observations.

For reference, Moran’s \\(I\\) is given as (Cliff and Ord 1981, 17): \\[ I = \\frac{n \\sum_{(2)} w_{ij} z_i z_j}{S_0 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} z_i^2} \\] where \\(x_i, i=1, \\ldots, n\\) are \\(n\\) observations on the numeric variable of interest, \\(z_i = x_i - \\bar{x}\\), \\(\\bar{x} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i / n\\), \\(\\sum_{(2)} = \\stackrel{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n}}{i \\neq j}\\), \\(w_{ij}\\) are the spatial weights, and \\(S_0 = \\sum_{(2)} w_{ij}\\). First we test a random variable using the Moran test, here under the normality assumption (argument randomisation=FALSE, default TRUE): set.seed(1) x &lt;- rnorm(nrow(pol_pres15)) mt &lt;- moran.test(x, lw_q_B, randomisation=FALSE) Inference is made on the statistic \\(Z(I) = \\frac{I - E(I)}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(I)}}\\), the z-value compared with the Normal distribution for \\(E(I)\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var}(I)\\) for the chosen assumptions; this x does not show spatial autocorrelation with these spatial weights: glance_htest &lt;- function(ht) c(ht$estimate, &quot;Std deviate&quot;=unname(ht$statistic), &quot;p.value=&quot;=unname(ht$p.value)) broom_ok &lt;- FALSE if (names(broom::tidy(mt))[1] == &quot;Moran I statistic&quot;) broom_ok &lt;- TRUE if (broom_ok) broom::tidy(mt)[,1:5] else glance_htest(mt) # Moran I statistic Expectation Variance Std deviate # -0.004772 -0.000401 0.000140 -0.369320 # p.value= # 0.644056 The test however fails to detect a missing trend in the data as a missing variable problem, finding spatial autocorrelation instead: beta &lt;- 0.5e-02 t &lt;- st_coordinates(coords)[,1]/1000 x_t &lt;- x + beta*t mt &lt;- moran.test(x_t, lw_q_B, randomisation=FALSE) if (broom_ok) broom::tidy(mt)[,1:5] else glance_htest(mt) # Moran I statistic Expectation Variance Std deviate # 3.56e-01 -4.01e-04 1.40e-04 3.01e+01 # p.value= # 2.63e-199 If we test the residuals of a linear model including the trend, the apparent spatial autocorrelation disappears: lmt &lt;- lm.morantest(lm(x_t ~ t), lw_q_B) if (broom_ok) broom::tidy(lmt)[,1:5] else glance_htest(lmt) # Observed Moran I Expectation Variance Std deviate # -0.004777 -0.000789 0.000140 -0.337306 # p.value= # 0.632057 A comparison of implementations of measures of spatial autocorrelation shows that a wide range of measures is available in R in a number of packages, chiefly in the spdep package, and that differences from other implementations can be attributed to design decisions (Bivand and Wong 2018). The spdep package also includes the only implementations of exact and Saddlepoint approximations to global and local Moran’s I for regression residuals (Tiefelsdorf 2002; Bivand, Müller, and Reder 2009). 15.3.1 Global measures We will begin by examining join count statistics, where joincount.test() takes a factor vector of values fx= and a listw object, and returns a list of htest (hypothesis test) objects defined in the stats package, one htest object for each level of the fx= argument. The observed counts are of neighbours with the same factor levels, known as same-colour joins. args(joincount.test) # function (fx, listw, zero.policy = NULL, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;, # sampling = &quot;nonfree&quot;, spChk = NULL, adjust.n = TRUE) # NULL The function takes an alternative= argument for hypothesis testing, a sampling= argument showing the basis for the construction of the variance of the measure, where the default \"nonfree\" choice corresponds to analytical permutation; the spChk= argument is retained for backward compatibility. For reference, the counts of factor levels for the type of municipality or Warsaw borough are: table(pol_pres15$types) # # Rural Urban Urban/rural Warsaw Borough # 1563 303 611 18 Since there are four levels, we re-arrange the list of htest objects to give a matrix of estimated results. The observed same-colour join counts are tabulated with their expectations based on the counts of levels of the input factor, so that few joins would be expected between for example Warsaw boroughs, because there are very few of them. The variance calculation uses the underlying constants of the chosen listw object and the counts of levels of the input factor. The z-value is obtained in the usual way by dividing the difference between the observed and expected join counts by the square root of the variance. The global tests in spdep return htest objects with a print() method in the stats package. To save space here, we’ll use a glance function if the broom::tidy() method has not been updated to use estimate names. jcl &lt;- joincount.test(pol_pres15$types, listw=lw_q_B) if (broom_ok) { nm &lt;- tibble::enframe(sapply(jcl, function(t) { nm &lt;- substring(names(t$statistic), 18) paste0(nm, &quot;:&quot;, nm) })) mat &lt;- cbind(nm, do.call(&quot;rbind&quot;, (lapply(jcl, broom::tidy)))) names(mat)[3] &lt;- &quot;Joincount&quot; names(mat)[6] &lt;- &quot;Std.deviate&quot; names(mat)[2] &lt;- &quot;&quot; mat[,2:6] } else { mat &lt;- t(sapply(jcl, glance_htest)) colnames(mat)[1] &lt;- &quot;Joincount&quot; rownames(mat) &lt;- sapply(jcl, function(t) { nm &lt;- substring(names(t$statistic), 18) paste0(nm, &quot;:&quot;, nm) }) mat } # Joincount Expectation Variance Std deviate # Rural:Rural 3087 2793.92 1126.534 8.732 # Urban:Urban 110 104.72 93.299 0.547 # Urban/rural:Urban/rural 656 426.53 331.759 12.599 # Warsaw Borough:Warsaw Borough 41 0.35 0.347 68.965 # p.value= # Rural:Rural 1.25e-18 # Urban:Urban 2.92e-01 # Urban/rural:Urban/rural 1.07e-36 # Warsaw Borough:Warsaw Borough 0.00e+00 The join count test was subsequently adapted for multi-colour join counts (Upton and Fingleton 1985).

Until now, we have considered the proportion of valid votes cast in relation to the numbers entitled to vote by spatial entity, but using EBImoran.mc() we can try to accommodate uncertainty in extreme rates in entities with small numbers entitled to vote. There is, however, little impact on the outcome in this case. set.seed(1) suppressMessages(ebimc &lt;- EBImoran.mc(n=pol_pres15$I_valid_votes, x=pol_pres15$I_entitled_to_vote, listw=lw_q_B, nsim=999, return_boot=TRUE)) if (broom_ok) broom::tidy(ebimc) else glance_boot(ebimc) # original bias std.error zvalue # 0.693 -0.693 0.012 57.742 A similar measure may also be achieved using global empirical Bayes estimators with EBest() to calculate a numerical vector of empirical Bayes estimates, but both are only limited ways of handling mis-specification in the mean model. Global measures of spatial autocorrelation using spatial weights objects based on graphs of neighbours are, as we have seen, rather blunt tools, which for interpretation depend critically on a reasoned mean model of the variable in question. If the mean model is just the intercept, the global measures will respond to all kinds of mis-specification, not only spatial autocorrelation. A key source of mis-specification will typically also include the choice of entities for aggregation of data. 15.3.2 Local measures Building on insights from the weaknesses of global measures, local indicators of spatial association began to appear in the first half of the 1990s (Anselin 1995; Getis and Ord 1992, 1996). In addition, the Moran plot was introduced, plotting the values of the variable of interest against their spatially lagged values, typically using row-standardised weights to make the axes more directly comparable (Anselin 1996). The moran.plot() function also returns an influence measures object used to label observations exerting more than propotional influence on the slope of the line representing global Moran’s \\(I\\). In this case, we can see that there are many spatial entities exerting such influence. These pairs of observed and lagged observed values make up in aggregate the global measure, but can also be explored in detail. The quadrants of the Moran plot also show low-low pairs in the lower left quadrant, high-high in the upper right quadrant, and fewer low-high and high-low pairs in the upper left and lower right quadrants. infl_W &lt;- moran.plot(pol_pres15$I_turnout, listw=lw_q_W, labels=pol_pres15$TERYT, cex=1, pch=&quot;.&quot;, xlab=&quot;I round turnout&quot;, ylab=&quot;lagged turnout&quot;, return_df = FALSE) Figure 15.3: Moran plot of I round turnout, row standardised weights If we extract the hat value influence measure from the returned object, a map suggests that some edge entities exert more than proportional influence, as do entities in or near larger urban areas. pol_pres15$hat_value &lt;- infl_W$infmat[,6] tm_shape(pol_pres15) + tm_fill(&quot;hat_value&quot;) Figure 15.4: Moran plot hat values, row standardised neighbours Bivand and Wong (2018) discuss issues impacting the use of local indicators, such as local Moran’s \\(I\\) and local Getis-Ord \\(G\\). Some issues affect the calculation of the local indicators, others inference from their values. Because \\(n\\) statistics may be being calculated from the same number of observations, there are multiple comparison problems that need to be addressed. Although the apparent detection of hotspots from values of local indicators has been quite widely adopted, it remains fraught with difficulty because adjustment of the inferential basis to accommodate multiple comparisons is not often chosen, and as in the global case, mis-specification also remains a source of confusion. Further, interpreting local spatial autocorrelation in the presence of global spatial autocorrelation is challenging (Ord and Getis 2001; Tiefelsdorf 2002; Bivand, Müller, and Reder 2009). The mlvar= and adjust.x= arguments to localmoran() are discussed in Bivand and Wong (2018), and permit matching with other implementations. The p.adjust.method= argument uses an untested speculation that adjustment should only take into account the cardinality of the neighbour set of each observation when adjusting for multiple comparisons; using stats::p.adjust() is preferable. args(localmoran) # function (x, listw, zero.policy = NULL, na.action = na.fail, # alternative = &quot;greater&quot;, p.adjust.method = &quot;none&quot;, mlvar = TRUE, # spChk = NULL, adjust.x = FALSE) # NULL Taking \"two.sided\" p-values because these local indicators when summed and divided by the sum of the spatial weights, and thus positive and negative local spatial autocorrelation may be present, we obtain: locm &lt;- localmoran(pol_pres15$I_turnout, listw=lw_q_B, alternative=&quot;two.sided&quot;) all.equal(sum(locm[,1])/Szero(lw_q_B), unname(moran.test(pol_pres15$I_turnout, lw_q_B)$estimate[1])) # [1] TRUE Using stats::p.adjust() to adjust for multiple comparisons, we see that almost 29% of the local measures have p-values &lt; 0.05 if no adjustment is applied, but only 12% using Bonferroni correction. pvs &lt;- cbind(locm[,5], p.adjust(locm[,5], &quot;bonferroni&quot;), p.adjust(locm[,5],&quot;fdr&quot;), p.adjust(locm[,5], &quot;BY&quot;)) colnames(pvs) &lt;- c(&quot;none&quot;, &quot;bonferroni&quot;, &quot;fdr&quot;, &quot;BY&quot;) apply(pvs, 2, function(x) sum(x &lt; 0.05)) # none bonferroni fdr BY # 715 297 576 424 The localmoran.sad() and localmoran.exact() functions take a fitted linear model, a select= argument to specify which observations to test (choosing only one removes the need to adjust for multiple comparisons), arguments like nb2listw() to build single observation star graphs of neighbours and their weights, and arguments needed for numerical estimation internally. They return lists of objects like \"htest\" objects, which may be coerced to data.frame objects. args(localmoran.sad) # function (model, select, nb, glist = NULL, style = &quot;W&quot;, zero.policy = NULL, # alternative = &quot;greater&quot;, spChk = NULL, resfun = weighted.residuals, # save.Vi = FALSE, tol = .Machine$double.eps^0.5, maxiter = 1000, # tol.bounds = 1e-04, save.M = FALSE, Omega = NULL) # NULL If we use localmoran.sad() to make saddlepoint approximations of the standard deviates of the local measures, and make the same corrections, we drop from 26% of the p-values &lt; 0.05 with no correction to under 2% using Bonferroni correction: locms &lt;- localmoran.sad(ols, nb=nb_q, style=&quot;B&quot;, alternative=&quot;two.sided&quot;) locms &lt;- as.data.frame(locms) pvss &lt;- cbind(locms[,5], p.adjust(locms[,5], &quot;bonferroni&quot;), p.adjust(locms[,5], &quot;fdr&quot;), p.adjust(locms[,5], &quot;BY&quot;)) colnames(pvss) &lt;- c(&quot;none&quot;, &quot;bonferroni&quot;, &quot;fdr&quot;, &quot;BY&quot;) apply(pvss, 2, function(x) sum(x &lt; 0.05)) # none bonferroni fdr BY # 646 44 314 87 Should we think it appropriate to take possible global spatial autocorrelation into account, we may fit a spatial regression model first. We can find the interval for the line search for the spatial coefficient \\(\\lambda\\) from the inverse of the extreme eigenvalues of the spatial weights, here using spatialreg::lextrB(): ints &lt;- 1/c(spatialreg::lextrB(lw_q_B)) ints # lambda_n lambda_1 # -0.293 0.157 From the output of a simultaneous autoregressive spatial error model, we see that the coefficient is close to its upper bound: SEM &lt;- spatialreg::errorsarlm(I_turnout ~ 1, data=pol_pres15, listw=lw_q_B, method=&quot;Matrix&quot;, interval=ints) spatialreg::coef.sarlm(SEM) # lambda (Intercept) # 0.139 0.459 The spatial error model is clearly a better description of the data than a mean model with just the intercept using a likelihood ratio test for comparison: spatialreg::LR1.sarlm(SEM) # # Likelihood Ratio diagnostics for spatial dependence # # data: # Likelihood ratio = 2111, df = 1, p-value &lt;2e-16 # sample estimates: # Log likelihood of spatial error model Log likelihood of OLS fit y # 4386 3330 Reconstructing a linear model after filtering out the global spatial autocorrelation \\((I - \\lambda W)\\) as lm.target, we can also construct \\((I - \\lambda W)^{-1}\\) representing the global spatial process as input to the Omega= argument. This is used internally to re-balance the matrix products of the per-observation star weights matrices, so involves substantial amounts of numerical linear algebra, including solving a dense matrix eigeneproblem, for each chosen observation. So if we take global autocorrelation into account, in this case the no-adjustment count of observations with p-values &lt; 0.05 is under 7%, and using Bonferroni correction, we drop to 0.2%. lm.target &lt;- lm(SEM$tary ~ SEM$tarX - 1) Omega &lt;- invIrW(lw_q_B, rho=SEM$lambda) locmsO &lt;- localmoran.sad(lm.target, nb=nb_q, style=&quot;B&quot;, alternative=&quot;two.sided&quot;, Omega=Omega) locmsO &lt;- as.data.frame(locmsO) pvssO &lt;- cbind(locmsO[,5], p.adjust(locmsO[,5], &quot;bonferroni&quot;), p.adjust(locmsO[,5], &quot;fdr&quot;), p.adjust(locmsO[,5], &quot;BY&quot;)) colnames(pvssO) &lt;- c(&quot;none&quot;, &quot;bonferroni&quot;, &quot;fdr&quot;, &quot;BY&quot;) apply(pvssO, 2, function(x) sum(x &lt; 0.05)) # none bonferroni fdr BY # 167 5 13 4 In the global measure case, bootstrap permutations could be used as an alternative to analytical methods for possible inference. In the local case, conditional permutation may be used, retaining the value at observation \\(i\\) and randomly sampling from the remaining \\(n-1\\) values to find randomised values at neighbours. x &lt;- pol_pres15$I_turnout lw &lt;- lw_q_B xx &lt;- mean(x) z &lt;- x - xx s2 &lt;- sum(z^2)/length(x) crd &lt;- card(lw$neighbours) nsim &lt;- 999 res_p &lt;- numeric(nsim) mns &lt;- numeric(length(x)) sds &lt;- numeric(length(x)) set.seed(1) for (i in seq(along=x)) { wtsi &lt;- lw$weights[[i]] zi &lt;- z[i] z_i &lt;- z[-i] crdi &lt;- crd[i] if (crdi &gt; 0) { for (j in 1:nsim) { sz_i &lt;- sample(z_i, size=crdi) lz_i &lt;- sum(sz_i*wtsi) res_p[j] &lt;- (zi/s2)*lz_i } mns[i] &lt;- mean(res_p) sds[i] &lt;- sd(res_p) } else { mns[i] &lt;- as.numeric(NA) sds[i] &lt;- as.numeric(NA) } } This approach is not provided as a function in spdep. The outcome is that almost 32% of observations have two sided p-values &lt; 0.05 without multiple comparison correction, and under 3% with Bonferroni correction. Since it is not advisable to use conditional permutation with regression residuals in the presence of spatial autocorrelation, localmoran.sad() and localmoran.exact() provide ways of calculating more robust standard deviates with the added flexibility of a possibly richer mean model. perm_Zi &lt;- (locm[,1] - mns)/sds pv &lt;- 2 * pnorm(abs(perm_Zi), lower.tail = FALSE) pvsp &lt;- cbind(pv, p.adjust(pv, &quot;bonferroni&quot;), p.adjust(pv, &quot;fdr&quot;), p.adjust(pv, &quot;BY&quot;)) colnames(pvsp) &lt;- c(&quot;none&quot;, &quot;bonferroni&quot;, &quot;fdr&quot;, &quot;BY&quot;) apply(pvsp, 2, function(x) sum(x &lt; 0.05)) # none bonferroni fdr BY # 789 68 477 160 In order to compare the results from localmoran() with the PySAL function in esda, we need first to re-run dividing by \\(n-1\\) instead of \\(n\\) in parts of the calculation, by setting the argument mlvar=FALSE. locm_nml &lt;- localmoran(pol_pres15$I_turnout, listw=lw_q_B, alternative=&quot;two.sided&quot;, mlvar=FALSE) Once this is done, the local estimates of Moran’s \\(I\\) agree within machine precision. np$random$seed(1L) loc_I_ps &lt;- esda$Moran_Local(pol_pres15$I_turnout, nb_gal_ps, transformation=&quot;B&quot;, permutations=999L) all.equal(unname(locm_nml[,1]), c(loc_I_ps$Is)) # [1] TRUE The PySAL outcomes after adjusting for multiple comparisons are also similar to those shown above: pv &lt;- 2 * pnorm(abs(loc_I_ps$z_sim), lower.tail = FALSE) pvsp &lt;- cbind(pv, p.adjust(pv, &quot;bonferroni&quot;), p.adjust(pv, &quot;fdr&quot;), p.adjust(pv, &quot;BY&quot;)) colnames(pvsp) &lt;- c(&quot;none&quot;, &quot;bonferroni&quot;, &quot;fdr&quot;, &quot;BY&quot;) apply(pvsp, 2, function(x) sum(x &lt; 0.05)) # none bonferroni fdr BY # 795 74 475 159 The figure shows the breadth of the density distribution of the standard deviates calculated using the analytical randomisation approach, compared with those of Saddlepoint approximation with and without the accommodation of global spatial autocorrelation, and with conditional permutation. df &lt;- data.frame(std_deviate=c(locm[,4], locms[,4], locmsO[,4], perm_Zi, loc_I_ps$z_sim), method=rep(c(&quot;Analytical randomisation&quot;, &quot;Saddlepoint approximation&quot;, &quot;Saddlepoint approximation (Omega)&quot;, &quot;Conditional permutation&quot;, &quot;Conditional permutation (PySAL)&quot;), each=2495)) library(ggplot2) ggplot(df) + geom_density(aes(x=std_deviate, fill=method), alpha=0.2) + xlim(c(-6, 12)) # Warning: Removed 26 rows containing non-finite values (stat_density).

In some cases, this heterogeneity may be modelled in the mean model through included covariates, or possibly using unstructured random effects, which may also reflect the differing scales of spatial process footprints. Here we will only mention two specifically spatial approaches, the local spatial heteroscedasticity (LOSH) statistic and Moran eigenvectors. 15.4.1 Local spatial heteroscedasticity (LOSH) statistic Local spatial heteroscedasticity (LOSH) statistics were introduced fairly recently, and an implementation was contributed to spdep even more recently, so there is as yet little experience with the approach (Ord and Getis 2012). It has been extended to provide bootstrap p-values for the measures of heterogeneity (Xu, Mei, and Yan 2014). The a= argument takes a default value of \\(2\\), giving a Chi-squared interpretation to output. args(LOSH) # function (x, listw, a = 2, var_hi = TRUE, zero.policy = NULL, # na.action = na.fail, spChk = NULL) # NULL lh &lt;- LOSH(pol_pres15$I_turnout, listw=lw_q_B) It is also possible to map local spatially weighted mean values derived from the local measures, showing a smoothing effect pol_pres15$x_bar_i &lt;- lh[,5] tm_shape(pol_pres15) + tm_fill(c(&quot;I_turnout&quot;, &quot;x_bar_i&quot;), title=&quot;Turnout&quot;, n=6, style=&quot;fisher&quot;) + tm_facets(free.scales=FALSE) + tm_borders(lwd=0.3, alpha=0.4) + tm_layout(panel.labels=c(&quot;Turnout&quot;, &quot;Weighted means&quot;)) Figure 15.8: Local spatially weighted mean values These approaches have been further extended but as yet without implementations in R (Westerholt, Resch, and Zipf 2015; Westerholt et al. 2018). 15.4.2 Moran eigenvectors There is a close connection between Moran’s \\(I\\) and the eigenproblem of the doubly centred weights matrix, and again with the spatial pattern of a variable of interest and combinations of eigenvectors of the same matrix (Griffith 2003, 2010; Chun and Griffith 2013). There is a literature in numerical ecology using the term of principle coordinates of neighbour matrices for the same approach. The value of global Moran’s \\(I\\) can be calculated using the hat matrix to centre the variable of interest in taking the cross products which yield Moran’s \\(I\\). n &lt;- nrow(pol_pres15) ones &lt;- rep(1, n) hat &lt;- (diag(n) - tcrossprod(ones) / n) Cmat &lt;- hat %*% listw2mat(lw_q_B) %*% hat x &lt;- pol_pres15$I_turnout I_MCM &lt;- c((n/Szero(lw_q_B) * crossprod(x, Cmat %*% x)/crossprod(x, hat %*% x))) I_MCM # [1] 0.691 The solution to the eigenproblem of matrix product gives us the eigenvectors, providing key information about the linkage structure of the graph of neighbours.

Spatial autoregressive models in two dimensions began without covariates and with clear links to time series (Whittle 1954). Extensions included tests for spatial autocorrelation in linear model residuals, and models applying the autoregressive component to the response or the residuals, where the latter matched the tests for residuals (Cliff and Ord 1972, 1973). These “lattice” models of areal data typically express the dependence between observations using a graph of neighbours in the form of a contiguity matrix. A division has grown up, possibly unhelpfully, between scientific fields using conditional autoregressive (CAR) models (Besag 1974), and simultaneous autoregressive models (SAR) (Ord 1975; Hepple 1976). Although CAR and SAR models are closely related, these fields have found it difficult to share experience of applying similar models, often despite referring to key work summarising the models (Ripley 1981, 1988; Cressie 1993). Ripley gives the SAR variance as (1981, 89): \\[ {\\rm Var}_S = \\sigma^ 2(I-\\lambda W_S)^{-1} (I-\\lambda W_S^{\\rm T})^{-1} \\] where \\(\\lambda\\) is a spatial autocorrelation parameter and \\(W_S\\) is a nonsingular matrix that represents spatial dependence. The CAR variance is: \\[ {\\rm Var}_C = \\sigma^ 2(I-\\lambda W_C)^{-1} \\] where and \\(W_C\\) is a symmetric and strictly positive definite matrix More recent books expounding the theoretical bases for modelling with areal data simply point out the similarities in relevant chapters (Gaetan and Guyon 2010; Lieshout 2019); the interested reader is invited to consult these sources for background information and examples using the functions described below. Of course, handling a spatial correlation structure in a generalised least squares model or a (generalised) linear or nonlinear mixed effects model such as those provided in the nlme and many other packages does not have to use a graph of neighbours (Pinheiro and Bates 2000). These models are also spatial regression models, using functions of the distance between observations, and fitted variograms to model the spatial autocorrelation present; such models have been held to yield a clearer picture of the underlying processes (Wall 2004), building on geostatistics. For example, the glmmTMB package successfully uses this approach to spatial regression (Brooks et al. 2017). Here we will only consider spatial regression using spatial weights, chiefly as implemented in the spatialreg package recently split out of the spdep package which had grown unnecessarily large, covering too many aspects of spatial dependence. 16.1 Spatial regression with spatial weights Spatial autoregression models using spatial weights matrices were described in some detail using maximum likelihood estimation some time ago (Cliff and Ord 1973, 1981). A family of models were elaborated in spatial econometric terms extending earlier work, and in many cases using the simultaneous autoregressive framework and row standardization of spatial weights (Anselin 1988). The simultaneous and conditional autoregressive frameworks can be compared, and both can be supplemented using case weights to reflect the relative importance of different observations (Waller and Gotway 2004). Here we shall use the Boston housing data set, which has been restructured and furnished with census tract boundaries (R. Bivand 2017). The original data set used 506 census tracts and a hedonic model to try to estimate willingness to pay for clean air. The response was constructed from counts of ordinal answers to a 1970 census question about house value; the response is left and right censored in the census source. The key covariate was created from a calibrated meteorological model showing the annual nitrogen oxides (NOX) level for a smaller number of model output zones. The numbers of houses responding also varies by tract and model output zone. There are several other covariates, some measured at the tract level, some by town only, where towns broadly correspond to the air pollution model output zones. library(sf) boston_506 &lt;- st_read(system.file(&quot;shapes/boston_tracts.shp&quot;, package=&quot;spData&quot;)[1]) # Reading layer `boston_tracts&#39; from data source `/home/edzer/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.0/spData/shapes/boston_tracts.shp&#39; using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39; # Simple feature collection with 506 features and 36 fields # geometry type: POLYGON # dimension: XY # bbox: xmin: -71.5 ymin: 42 xmax: -70.6 ymax: 42.7 # geographic CRS: NAD27 nb_q &lt;- spdep::poly2nb(boston_506) lw_q &lt;- spdep::nb2listw(nb_q, style=&quot;W&quot;) We can start by reading in the 506 tract data set from spData, and creating a contiguity neighbour object and from that again a row standardized spatial weights object. If we examine the median house values, we find that they have been assigned as missing values, and that 17 tracts are affected. table(boston_506$censored) # # left no right # 2 489 15 summary(boston_506$median) # Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. NA&#39;s # 5600 16800 21000 21749 24700 50000 17 Next, we can subset to the remaining 489 tracts with non-censored house values, and the neighbour object to match. The neighbour object now has one observation with no neighbours. boston_489 &lt;- boston_506[!is.na(boston_506$median),] nb_q_489 &lt;- spdep::poly2nb(boston_489) lw_q_489 &lt;- spdep::nb2listw(nb_q_489, style=&quot;W&quot;, zero.policy=TRUE) The NOX_ID variable specifies the upper level aggregation, letting us aggregate the tracts to air pollution model output zones. We can create aggregate neighbour and row standardized spatial weights objects, and aggregate the NOX variable taking means, and the CHAS Charles River dummy variable for observations on the river. agg_96 &lt;- list(as.character(boston_506$NOX_ID)) boston_96 &lt;- aggregate(boston_506[, &quot;NOX_ID&quot;], by=agg_96, unique) nb_q_96 &lt;- spdep::poly2nb(boston_96) lw_q_96 &lt;- spdep::nb2listw(nb_q_96) boston_96$NOX &lt;- aggregate(boston_506$NOX, agg_96, mean)$x boston_96$CHAS &lt;- aggregate(as.integer(boston_506$CHAS)-1, agg_96, max)$x The response is aggregated using the weightedMedian() function in matrixStats, and midpoint values for the house value classes. Counts of houses by value class were punched to check the published census values, which can be replicated using weightedMedian() at the tract level. Here we find two output zones with calculated weighted medians over the upper census question limit of USD 50,000, and remove them subsequently as they also are affected by not knowing the appropriate value to insert for the top class by value. nms &lt;- names(boston_506) ccounts &lt;- 23:31 for (nm in nms[c(22, ccounts, 36)]) { boston_96[[nm]] &lt;- aggregate(boston_506[[nm]], agg_96, sum)$x } br2 &lt;- c(3.50, 6.25, 8.75, 12.50, 17.50, 22.50, 30.00, 42.50, 60.00)*1000 counts &lt;- as.data.frame(boston_96)[, nms[ccounts]] f &lt;- function(x) matrixStats::weightedMedian(x=br2, w=x, interpolate=TRUE) boston_96$median &lt;- apply(counts, 1, f) is.na(boston_96$median) &lt;- boston_96$median &gt; 50000 summary(boston_96$median) # Min. 1st Qu.

The original model related the log of median house values by tract to the square of NOX values, including other covariates usually related to house value by tract, such as aggregate room counts, aggregate age, ethnicity, social status, distance to downtown and to the nearest radial road, a crime rate, and town-level variables reflecting land use (zoning, industry), taxation and education (R. Bivand 2017). This structure will be used here to exercise issues raised in fitting spatial regression models, including the presence of multiple levels. form &lt;- formula(log(median) ~ CRIM + ZN + INDUS + CHAS + I((NOX*10)^2) + I(RM^2) + AGE + log(DIS) + log(RAD) + TAX + PTRATIO + I(BB/100) + log(I(LSTAT/100))) Before moving to presentations of issues raised in fitting spatial regression models, it is worth making a few further points. A recent review of spatial regression in a spatial econometrics setting is given by Kelejian and Piras (2017); note that their usage is to call the spatial coefficient of the lagged response \\(\\lambda\\) and that of the lagged residuals \\(\\rho\\), the reverse of other usage (Anselin 1988; LeSage and Pace 2009); here we use \\(\\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}}\\) for the spatial coefficient in the spatial lag model, and \\(\\rho_{\\mathrm{Err}}\\) for the spatial error model. One interesting finding is that relatively dense spatial weights matrices may downweight model estimates, suggesting that sparser weights are preferable (Smith 2009). Another useful finding is that the presence of residual spatial autocorrelation need not bias the estimates of variance of regression coefficients, provided that the covariates themselves do not exhibit spatial autocorrelation (Smith and Lee 2012). In general, however, the footprints of the spatial processes of the response and covariates may not be aligned, and if covariates and the residual are autocorrelated, it is likely that the estimates of variance of regression coefficients will be biassed downwards if attempts are not made to model the spatial processes. In trying to model these spatial processes, we may choose to model the spatial autocorrelation in the residual with a spatial error model (SEM). \\[ {\\mathbf y} = {\\mathbf X}{\\mathbf \\beta} + {\\mathbf u}, \\qquad {\\mathbf u} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{Err}} {\\mathbf W} {\\mathbf u} + {\\mathbf \\varepsilon}, \\] where \\({\\mathbf y}\\) is an \\((N \\times 1)\\) vector of observations on a response variable taken at each of \\(N\\) locations, \\({\\mathbf X}\\) is an \\((N \\times k)\\) matrix of covariates, \\({\\mathbf \\beta}\\) is a \\((k \\times 1)\\) vector of parameters, \\({\\mathbf u}\\) is an \\((N \\times 1)\\) spatially autocorrelated disturbance vector, \\({\\mathbf \\varepsilon}\\) is an \\((N \\times 1)\\) vector of independent and identically distributed disturbances and \\(\\rho_{\\mathrm{Err}}\\) is a scalar spatial parameter. If the processes in the covariates and the response match, we should find little difference between the coefficients of a least squares and a SEM, but very often they diverge, suggesting that a Hausman test for this condition should be employed (Pace and LeSage 2008). This may be related to earlier discussions of a spatial equivalent to the unit root and cointegration where spatial processes match (Fingleton 1999). A model with a spatial process in the response only is termed a spatial lag model (SLM, often SAR - spatial autoregressive) (LeSage and Pace 2009). \\[ {\\mathbf y} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}} {\\mathbf W}{\\mathbf y} + {\\mathbf X}{\\mathbf \\beta} + {\\mathbf \\varepsilon}, \\] where \\(\\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}}\\) is a scalar spatial parameter. Work reviewed by Mur and Angulo (2006) on the Durbin model; the Durbin model adds the spatially lagged covariates to the covariates included in the spatial lag model, giving a spatial Durbin model (SDM) with different processes in the response and covariates: \\[ {\\mathbf y} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}} {\\mathbf W}{\\mathbf y} + {\\mathbf X}{\\mathbf \\beta} + {\\mathbf W}{\\mathbf X}{\\mathbf \\gamma} + {\\mathbf \\varepsilon}, \\] where \\({\\mathbf \\gamma}\\) is a \\((k&#39; \\times 1)\\) vector of parameters. \\(k&#39;\\) defines the subset of the intercept and covariates, often \\(k&#39; = k-1\\) when using row standardised spatial weights and omitting the spatially lagged intercept. This permits the spatial processes to be viewed and tested for as a Common Factor (Burridge 1981; Bivand 1984). The inclusion of spatially lagged covariates lets us check whether the same spatial process is manifest in the response and the covariates (SEM), whether they are different processes, or whether no process is detected. The Common Factor is present when \\({\\mathbf \\gamma} = - \\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}} {\\mathbf \\beta}\\): \\[ {\\mathbf y} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}} {\\mathbf W}{\\mathbf y} + {\\mathbf X}{\\mathbf \\beta} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}} {\\mathbf W}{\\mathbf X} {\\mathbf \\beta} + {\\mathbf \\varepsilon}, \\qquad ({\\mathbf I} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}} {\\mathbf W}){\\mathbf y} = ({\\mathbf I} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}} {\\mathbf W}) {\\mathbf X}{\\mathbf \\beta} + {\\mathbf \\varepsilon}, \\] where \\({\\mathbf I}\\) is the \\(N \\times N\\) identity matrix, and \\({\\mathbf I} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}} {\\mathbf W}\\) is the Common Factor: \\[ \\qquad {\\mathbf y} = {\\mathbf X}{\\mathbf \\beta} + ({\\mathbf I} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}} {\\mathbf W})^{-1} {\\mathbf \\varepsilon}, \\qquad {\\mathbf y} = {\\mathbf X}{\\mathbf \\beta} + {\\mathbf u}, \\qquad {\\mathbf u} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{Err}} {\\mathbf W} {\\mathbf u} + {\\mathbf \\varepsilon}, \\] If we extend this family with processes in the covariates and the residual, we get a spatial error Durbin model (SDEM). If it is chosen to admit a spatial process in the residuals in addition to a spatial process in the response, again two models are formed, a general nested model (GNM) nesting all the others, and a model without spatially lagged covariates (SAC, also known as SARAR - Spatial AutoRegressive-AutoRegressive model). If neither the residuals nor the residual are modelled with spatial processes, spatially lagged covariates may be added to a linear model, as a spatially lagged X model (SLX) (Elhorst 2010; Bivand 2012; LeSage 2014; Halleck Vega and Elhorst 2015). We can write the general nested model (GNM) as: \\[ {\\mathbf y} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}} {\\mathbf W}{\\mathbf y} + {\\mathbf X}{\\mathbf \\beta} + {\\mathbf W}{\\mathbf X}{\\mathbf \\gamma} + {\\mathbf u}, \\qquad {\\mathbf u} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{Err}} {\\mathbf W} {\\mathbf u} + {\\mathbf \\varepsilon}, \\] This may be constrained to the double spatial coefficient model SAC/SARAR by setting \\({\\mathbf \\gamma} = 0\\), to the spatial Durbin (SDM) by setting \\(\\rho_{\\mathrm{Err}} = 0\\), and to the error Durbin model (SDEM) by setting \\(\\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}} = 0\\). Imposing more conditions gives the spatial lag model (SLM) with \\({\\mathbf \\gamma} = 0\\) and \\(\\rho_{\\mathrm{Err}} = 0\\), the spatial error model (SEM) with \\({\\mathbf \\gamma} = 0\\) and \\(\\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}} = 0\\), and the spatially lagged X model (SLX) with \\(\\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}} = 0\\) and \\(\\rho_{\\mathrm{Err}} = 0\\). Although making predictions for new locations for which covariates are observed was raised as an issue some time ago, it has many years to make progress in reviewing the possibilities (Bivand 2002; Goulard, Laurent, and Thomas-Agnan 2017). The prediction methods for SLM, SDM, SEM, SDEM, SAC and GNM models fitted with maximum likelihood were contributed as a Google Summer of Coding project by Martin Gubri. This work, and work on similar models with missing data (Suesse 2018) is also relevant for exploring censored median house values in the Boston data set. Work on prediction also exposed the importance of the reduced form of these models, in which the spatial process in the response interacts with the regression coefficients in the SLM, SDM, SAC and GNM models. The consequence of these interactions is that a unit change in a covariate will only impact the response as the value of the regression coefficient if the spatial coefficient of the lagged response is zero. Where it is non-zero, global spillovers, impacts, come into play, and these impacts should be reported rather than the regression coefficients (LeSage and Pace 2009; Elhorst 2010; Bivand 2012; LeSage 2014; Halleck Vega and Elhorst 2015). Local impacts may be reported for SDEM and SLX models, using linear combination to calculate standard errors for the total impacts of each covariate (sums of coefficients on the covariates and their spatial lags). This can be seen from the GNM data generation process: \\[ ({\\mathbf I} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{Err}} {\\mathbf W})({\\mathbf I} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}} {\\mathbf W}){\\mathbf y} = ({\\mathbf I} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{Err}} {\\mathbf W})({\\mathbf X}{\\mathbf \\beta} + {\\mathbf W}{\\mathbf X}{\\mathbf \\gamma}) + {\\mathbf \\varepsilon}, \\] re-writing: \\[ {\\mathbf y} = ({\\mathbf I} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}} {\\mathbf W})^{-1}({\\mathbf X}{\\mathbf \\beta} + {\\mathbf W}{\\mathbf X}{\\mathbf \\gamma}) + ({\\mathbf I} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}} {\\mathbf W})^{-1}({\\mathbf I} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{Err}} {\\mathbf W})^{-1}{\\mathbf \\varepsilon}. \\] There is interaction between the \\(\\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}}\\) and \\({\\mathbf \\beta}\\) (and \\({\\mathbf \\gamma}\\) if present) coefficients. This can be seen from the partial derivatives: \\(\\partial y_i / \\partial x_{jr} = (({\\mathbf I} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}} {\\mathbf W})^{-1} ({\\mathbf I} \\beta_r + {\\mathbf W} \\gamma_r))_{ij}\\). This dense matrix \\(S_r({\\mathbf W}) = (({\\mathbf I} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{Lag}} {\\mathbf W})^{-1} ({\\mathbf I} \\beta_r + {\\mathbf W} \\gamma_r))\\) expresses the direct impacts (effects) on its principal diagonal, and indirect impacts in off-diagonal elements. Current work in the spatialreg package is focused on refining the handling of spatially lagged covariates using a consistent Durbin= argument taking either a logical value or a formula giving the subset of covariates to add in spatially lagged form. There is a speculation that some covariates, for example some dummy variables, should not be added in spatially lagged form. This then extends to handling these included spatially lagged covariates appropriately in calculating impacts. This work applies to cross-sectional models fitted using MCMC or maximum likelihood, and will offer facilities to spatial panel models. It is worth mentioning the almost unexplored issues of functional form assumptions, for which flexible structures are useful, including spatial quantile regression presented in the McSpatial package (McMillen 2013). There are further issues with discrete response variables, covered by some functions in McSpatial, and in the spatialprobit and ProbitSpatial packages (Wilhelm and Matos 2013; Martinetti and Geniaux 2017); the MCMC implementations of the former are based on LeSage and Pace (2009). Finally, Wagner and Zeileis (2019) show how an SLM model may be used in the setting of recursive partitioning, with an implementation using spatialreg::lagsarlm() in the lagsarlmtree package. 16.2 Estimators The review of cross-sectional maximum likelihood and generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators in spatialreg and sphet for spatial econometrics style spatial regression models by Bivand and Piras (2015) is still largely valid. In the review, estimators in these R packages were compared with alternative implementations available in other programming languages elsewhere. The review did not cover Bayesian spatial econometrics style spatial regression. More has changed with respect to spatial panel estimators described in Millo and Piras (2012), but will not be covered here. 16.2.1 Maximum likelihood For models with single spatial coefficients (SEM and SDEM using errorsarlm(), SLM and SDM using lagsarlm()), the methods initially described by Ord (1975) are used. The following table shows the functions that can be used to estimate the models described above using maximum likelihood. model model name maximum likelihood estimation function SEM spatial error errorsarlm(..., Durbin=FALSE, ...) SEM spatial error spautolm(..., family=\"SAR\", ...) SDEM spatial Durbin error errorsarlm(..., Durbin=TRUE, ...) SLM spatial lag lagsarlm(..., Durbin=FALSE, ...) SDM spatial Durbin lagsarlm(..., Durbin=TRUE, ...) SAC spatial autoregressive combined sacsarlm(..., Durbin=FALSE, ...) GNM general nested sacsarlm(..., Durbin=TRUE, ...) The estimating functions errorsarlm() and lagsarlm() take similar arguments, where the first two, formula= and data= are shared by most model estimating functions. The third argument is a listw spatial weights object, while na.action= behaves as in other model estimating functions if the spatial weights can reasonably be subsetted to avoid observations with missing values. The weights= argument may be used to provide weights indicating the known degree of per-observation variability in the variance term - this is not available for lagsarlm(). library(spatialreg) # Loading required package: Matrix # # Attaching package: &#39;Matrix&#39; # The following objects are masked from &#39;package:tidyr&#39;: # # expand, pack, unpack # # Attaching package: &#39;spatialreg&#39; # The following objects are masked from &#39;package:spdep&#39;: # # anova.sarlm, as_dgRMatrix_listw, as_dsCMatrix_I, as_dsCMatrix_IrW, # as_dsTMatrix_listw, as.spam.listw, bptest.sarlm, can.be.simmed, # cheb_setup, coef.gmsar, coef.sarlm, coef.spautolm, coef.stsls, # create_WX, deviance.gmsar, deviance.sarlm, deviance.spautolm, # deviance.stsls, do_ldet, eigen_pre_setup, eigen_setup, eigenw, # errorsarlm, fitted.gmsar, fitted.ME_res, fitted.sarlm, # fitted.SFResult, fitted.spautolm, get.ClusterOption, # get.coresOption, get.mcOption, get.VerboseOption, # get.ZeroPolicyOption, GMargminImage, GMerrorsar, griffith_sone, # gstsls, Hausman.test, HPDinterval.lagImpact, impacts, intImpacts, # Jacobian_W, jacobianSetup, l_max, lagmess, lagsarlm, lextrB, # lextrS, lextrW, lmSLX, logLik.sarlm, logLik.spautolm, LR.sarlm, # LR1.sarlm, LR1.spautolm, LU_prepermutate_setup, LU_setup, # Matrix_J_setup, Matrix_setup, mcdet_setup, MCMCsamp, ME, mom_calc, # mom_calc_int2, moments_setup, powerWeights, predict.sarlm, # predict.SLX, print.gmsar, print.ME_res, print.sarlm, # print.sarlm.pred, print.SFResult, print.spautolm, print.stsls, # print.summary.gmsar, print.summary.sarlm, print.summary.spautolm, # print.summary.stsls, residuals.gmsar, residuals.sarlm, # residuals.spautolm, residuals.stsls, sacsarlm, SE_classic_setup, # SE_interp_setup, SE_whichMin_setup, set.ClusterOption, # set.coresOption, set.mcOption, set.VerboseOption, # set.ZeroPolicyOption, similar.listw, spam_setup, spam_update_setup, # SpatialFiltering, spautolm, spBreg_err, spBreg_lag, spBreg_sac, # stsls, subgraph_eigenw, summary.gmsar, summary.sarlm, # summary.spautolm, summary.stsls, trW, vcov.sarlm, Wald1.sarlm args(errorsarlm) # function (formula, data = list(), listw, na.action, weights = NULL, # Durbin, etype, method = &quot;eigen&quot;, quiet = NULL, zero.policy = NULL, # interval = NULL, tol.solve = .Machine$double.eps, trs = NULL, # control = list()) # NULL args(lagsarlm) # function (formula, data = list(), listw, na.action, Durbin, type, # method = &quot;eigen&quot;, quiet = NULL, zero.policy = NULL, interval = NULL, # tol.solve = .Machine$double.eps, trs = NULL, control = list()) # NULL The Durbin= argument replaces the earlier type= and etype= arguments, and if not given is taken as FALSE. If given, it may be FALSE, TRUE in which case all spatially lagged covariates are included, or a one-sided formula specifying which spatially lagged covariates should be included. The method= argument gives the method for calculating the log determinant term in the log likelihood function, and defaults to \"eigen\", suitable for moderately sized data sets. The interval= argument gives the bounds of the domain for the line search using stats::optimize() used for finding the spatial coefficient. The tol.solve() argument, passed through to base::solve(), was needed to handle data sets with differing numerical scales among the coefficients which hindered inversion of the variance-covariance matrix; the default value in base::solve() used to be much larger. The control= argument takes a list of control values to permit more careful adjustment of the running of the estimation function. The spautolm() function also fits spatial regressions with the spatial process in the residuals, and takes a possibly poorly named family= argument, taking the values of \"SAR\" for the simultaneous autoregressive model (like errorsarlm()), \"CAR\" for the conditional autoregressive model, and \"SMA\" for the spatial moving average model. args(spautolm) # function (formula, data = list(), listw, weights, na.action, # family = &quot;SAR&quot;, method = &quot;eigen&quot;, verbose = NULL, trs = NULL, # interval = NULL, zero.policy = NULL, tol.solve = .Machine$double.eps, # llprof = NULL, control = list()) # NULL The sacsarlm() function may take second spatial weights and interval arguments if the spatial weights used to model the two spatial processes in the SAC and GNM specifications differ. By default, the same spatial weights are used. By default, stats::nlminb() is used for numerical optimization, using a heuristic to choose starting values. args(sacsarlm) # function (formula, data = list(), listw, listw2 = NULL, na.action, # Durbin, type, method = &quot;eigen&quot;, quiet = NULL, zero.policy = NULL, # tol.solve = .Machine$double.eps, llprof = NULL, interval1 = NULL, # interval2 = NULL, trs1 = NULL, trs2 = NULL, control = list()) # NULL Where larger data sets are used, a numerical Hessian approach is used to calculate the variance-covariance matrix of coefficients, rather than an analytical asymptotic approach. Apart from spautolm() which returns an \"spautolm\" object, the model fitting functions return \"sarlm\" objects. Standard methods for fitted models are provided, such as summary(): args(summary.sarlm) # function (object, correlation = FALSE, Nagelkerke = FALSE, Hausman = FALSE, # adj.se = FALSE, ...) # NULL The Nagelkerke= argument permits the return of a value approximately corresponding to a coefficient of determination, although the summary method anyway provides the value of stats::AIC() because a stats::logLik() method is provided for \"sarlm\" and \"spautolm\" objects. If the \"sarlm\" object is a SEM or SDEM, the Hausman test may be performed by setting Hausman=TRUE to see whether the regression coefficients are sufficiently like least squares coefficients, indicating absence of mis-specification from that source. As an example, we may fit SEM and SDEM to the 94 and 489 observation Boston data sets, and present the Hausman test results: eigs_489 &lt;- eigenw(lw_q_489) SDEM_489 &lt;- errorsarlm(form, data=boston_489, listw=lw_q_489, Durbin=TRUE, zero.policy=TRUE, control=list(pre_eig=eigs_489)) SEM_489 &lt;- errorsarlm(form, data=boston_489, listw=lw_q_489, zero.policy=TRUE, control=list(pre_eig=eigs_489)) cbind(data.frame(model=c(&quot;SEM&quot;, &quot;SDEM&quot;)), rbind(broom::tidy(Hausman.test(SEM_489)), broom::tidy(Hausman.test(SDEM_489))))[,1:4] # model statistic p.value parameter # 1 SEM 52.0 2.83e-06 14 # 2 SDEM 48.7 6.48e-03 27 Here we are using the control= list argument to pass through pre-computed eigenvalues for the default \"eigen\" method. Both test results for the 489 tract data set suggest that the regression coefficients do differ, perhaps that the footprints of the spatial processes do not match. Likelihood ratio tests of the spatial models against their least squares equivalents show that spatial process(es) are present, but we find that neither SEM not SDM are adequate representations. cbind(data.frame(model=c(&quot;SEM&quot;, &quot;SDEM&quot;)), rbind(broom::tidy(LR1.sarlm(SEM_489)), broom::tidy(LR1.sarlm(SDEM_489))))[,c(1, 4:6)] # model statistic p.value parameter # 1 SEM 198 0 1 # 2 SDEM 159 0 1 For the 94 air pollution model output zones, the Hausman tests find little difference between coefficients, but this is related to the fact that the SEM and SDEM models add little to least squares or SLX using likelihood ratio tests. eigs_94 &lt;- eigenw(lw_q_94) SDEM_94 &lt;- errorsarlm(form, data=boston_94, listw=lw_q_94, Durbin=TRUE, control=list(pre_eig=eigs_94)) SEM_94 &lt;- errorsarlm(form, data=boston_94, listw=lw_q_94, control=list(pre_eig=eigs_94)) cbind(data.frame(model=c(&quot;SEM&quot;, &quot;SDEM&quot;)), rbind(broom::tidy(Hausman.test(SEM_94)), broom::tidy(Hausman.test(SDEM_94))))[, 1:4] # model statistic p.value parameter # 1 SEM 15.66 0.335 14 # 2 SDEM 9.21 0.999 27 cbind(data.frame(model=c(&quot;SEM&quot;, &quot;SDEM&quot;)), rbind(broom::tidy(LR1.sarlm(SEM_94)), broom::tidy(LR1.sarlm(SDEM_94))))[,c(1, 4:6)] # model statistic p.value parameter # 1 SEM 2.593 0.107 1 # 2 SDEM 0.216 0.642 1 We can use spatialreg::LR.sarlm() to apply a likelihood ratio test between nested models, but here choose lmtest::lrtest(), which gives the same results, preferring models including spatially lagged covariates. broom::tidy(lmtest::lrtest(SEM_489, SDEM_489)) # Warning in tidy.anova(lmtest::lrtest(SEM_489, SDEM_489)): The following column # names in ANOVA output were not recognized or transformed: X.Df, LogLik # # A tibble: 2 x 5 # X.Df LogLik df statistic p.value # &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; # 1 16 273.

This, and the use of spatially lagged covariates in the moment conditions for models including a spatial process in the residuals, means that including the spatially lagged covariates in the initial model is challenging, and functions in the sphet package do not provide a Durbin= argument. This makes it harder to accommodate data with multiple spatial process footprints. However, as Kelejian and Piras show in their recent review (2017), these approaches have other benefits, such as being able to instrument variables suspected of suffering from endogeneity or measurement error. Let us first compare the ML and GMM estimates of the SEM regression coefficients for rescaled squared NOX values. We use the sphet::spreg() wrapper function, and fit a SEM model. Extracting the matching rows from the summary objects for these models, we can see that the values are not dissimilar, despite the difference in estimation methods. library(sphet) SEM1_94 &lt;- spreg(form, data=boston_94, listw=lw_q_94, model=&quot;error&quot;) res &lt;- rbind(summary(SEM_94)$Coef[&quot;I((NOX * 10)^2)&quot;,], summary(SEM1_94)$CoefTable[&quot;I((NOX * 10)^2)&quot;,]) rownames(res) &lt;- c(&quot;ML&quot;, &quot;GMM&quot;) res # Estimate Std.

The endog= argument takes a one-sided formula for the variables to be modelled in the first stage of the model. Had we re-run the original air pollution model many times under slightly varying scenarios, we could have used an ensemble of NOX loadings to yield its distribution by output zone. Because this is not possible, we assume that the measurement error can be captured by using selected instruments. Unfortunately, the NOX regression coefficient estimate from the second stage has fallen substantially in absolute size, although the sign is unchanged. formiv &lt;- update(form, . ~ . - I((NOX*10)^2)) boston_94$NOX2 &lt;- (boston_94$NOX*10)^2 suppressWarnings(ccoords &lt;- st_coordinates(st_centroid(st_geometry(boston_94)))) iform &lt;- formula(~poly(ccoords, degree=2) + DIS + RAD) SEM1_94iv &lt;- spreg(formiv, data=boston_94, listw=lw_q_94, endog = ~NOX2, instruments=iform, model=&quot;error&quot;) summary(SEM1_94iv)$CoefTable[&quot;NOX2&quot;,] # Estimate Std. Error t-value Pr(&gt;|t|) # -0.00195 0.00454 -0.43063 0.66674 Handling measurement error in this or similar ways is one of the benefits of GMM estimation methods, although here the choice of instruments was somewhat arbitrary. 16.2.3 Markov chain Monte Carlo (draft - a comparative piece is being written for submission in about two months) The Spatial Econometrics Library is part of the extensive Matlab code repository at https://www.spatial-econometrics.com/ and documented in LeSage and Pace (2009). The Google Summer of Coding project in 2011 by Abhirup Mallik mentored by Virgilio Gómez-Rubio yielded translations of some of the model fitting functions for SEM, SDEM, SLM, SDM, SAC and GNM from the Matlab code. These have now been added to spatialreg as spBreg_err(), spBreg_lag() and spBreg_sac() with Durbin= arguments to handle the inclusion of spatially lagged covariates. As yet, heteroskedastic disturbances are not accommodated. The functions return \"mcmc\" objects as specified in the coda package, permitting the use of tools from coda for handling model output. The default burnin is 500 draws, followed by default 2000 draws returned, but these values and many others may be set through the control= list argument. Fitting the SDEM model for the output zones takes about an order of magnitude longer than using ML, but there is more work to do subsequently, and this difference scales more in the number of samples than covariates or observations. system.time(SDEM_94B &lt;- spBreg_err(form, data=boston_94, listw=lw_q_94, Durbin=TRUE)) # user system elapsed # 1.692 0.004 1.695 system.time(SDEM_489B &lt;- spBreg_err(form, data=boston_489, listw=lw_q_489, Durbin=TRUE, zero.policy=TRUE)) # user system elapsed # 2.63 0.00 2.63 Most time in the ML case using eigenvalues is taken by log determinant setup and optimization, and by dense matrix asymptotic standard errors if chosen (always chosen with default \"eigen\" log determinant method): t(errorsarlm(form, data=boston_94, listw=lw_q_94, Durbin=TRUE)$timings[,2]) # set_up eigen_set_up eigen_opt coefs eigen_hcov eigen_se # [1,] 0.005 0.006 0.009 0.004 0.001 0.002 t(errorsarlm(form, data=boston_489, listw=lw_q_489, Durbin=TRUE, zero.policy=TRUE)$timings[,2]) # set_up eigen_set_up eigen_opt coefs eigen_hcov eigen_se # [1,] 0.012 0.059 0.021 0.005 0.094 0.194 while in the MCMC case, the default use of Spatial Econometric Toolbox gridded log determinants and obviously sampling takes most time: t(attr(SDEM_94B, &quot;timings&quot;)[ , 3]) # set_up SE_classic_set_up complete_setup sampling finalise # [1,] 0.006 0.26 0.032 1.34 0.057 t(attr(SDEM_489B, &quot;timings&quot;)[ , 3]) # set_up SE_classic_set_up complete_setup sampling finalise # [1,] 0.009 0.428 0.072 2.05 0.067 However, as we will see shortly, inference from model impacts may need sampling (where the spatially lagged response is included in the model), and in the case of MCMC models, the samples have already been drawn. 16.3 Implementation details We will briefly touch on selected implementation details that applied users of spatial regression models would be wise to review. The handling of the log determinant term applies to all such users, while impacts are restricted to those employing spatial econometrics style models either including the spatially lagged response or including spatially lagged covariates. 16.3.1 Handling the log determinant term It has been known for over twenty years that the sparse matrix representation of spatial weights overcomes the difficulties of fitting models with larger numbers of observations using maximum likelihood and MCMC where the log determinant term comes into play (R. K. Pace and Barry 1997a, 1997c, 1997d, 1997b). During the development of these approaches in model fitting functions in spatialreg, use was first made of C code also used in the S-PLUS SpatialStats module (Kaluzny et al. 1998), then SparseM which used a compressed sparse row form very similar to \"nb\" and \"listw\" objects. This was followed by the use of spam and Matrix methods, both of which mainly use compressed sparse column representations. Details are provided in Bivand, Hauke and Kossowski (2013). The domain of the spatial coefficient(s) is given by the interval= argument to model fitting functions, and returned in the fitted object: SEM_94$interval # [1] -1.53 1.00 This case is trivial, because the upper bound is unity by definition, because of the use of row standardization. The interval is the inverse of the range of the eigenvalues of the weights matrix: 1/range(eigs_94) # [1] -1.53 1.00 Finding the interval within which to search for the spatial coefficient is trivial for smaller data sets, but more complex for larger ones. It is possible to use heuristics implemented in lextrW() (Griffith, Bivand, and Chun 2015): 1/c(lextrW(lw_q_94)) # lambda_n lambda_1 # -1.53 1.00 or RSpectra::eigs() after coercion to a Matrix package compressed sparse column representation: W &lt;- as(lw_q_94, &quot;CsparseMatrix&quot;) 1/Re(c(RSpectra::eigs(W, k=1, which=&quot;SR&quot;)$values, RSpectra::eigs(W, k=1, which=&quot;LR&quot;)$values)) # [1] -1.53 1.00 Why are we extracting the real part of the values returned by eigs()? Since nb_q_94 is symmetric, the row-standardized object lw_q_94 is symmetric by similarity, a result known since Ord (1975); consequently, we can take the real part without concern. Had the underlying neighbour relationships not been symmetric, we should be more careful. The baseline log determinant term as given by Ord (1975) for a coefficient value proposed in sampling or during numerical optimization; this extract matches the \"eigen\" method (with or without control=list(pre_eig=...)\"): coef &lt;- 0.5 sum(log(1 - coef * eigs_94)) # [1] -2.87 Using sparse matrix functions from Matrix, the LU decomposition can be used for asymmetric matrices; this extract matches the \"LU\" method: I &lt;- Diagonal(nrow(boston_94)) LU &lt;- lu(I - coef * W) dU &lt;- abs(diag(slot(LU, &quot;U&quot;))) sum(log(dU)) # [1] -2.87 and Cholesky decomposition for symmetric matrices, with similar.listw() used to handle asymmetric weights that are similar to symmetric. The default value od super allows the underlying Matrix code to choose between supernodal or simplicial decomposition; this extract matches the \"Matrix_J\" method: W &lt;- as(similar.listw(lw_q_94), &quot;CsparseMatrix&quot;) super &lt;- as.logical(NA) cch &lt;- Cholesky((I - coef * W), super=super) c(2 * determinant(cch, logarithm = TRUE)$modulus) # [1] -2.87 The \"Matrix\" and \"spam_update\" methods are to be preferred as they pre-compute the fill-reducing permutation of the decomposition since the weights do not change for different values of the coefficient. Maximum likelihood model fitting functions in spatialreg and splm use jacobianSetup() to populate env= environment with intermediate objects needed to find log determinants during optimization. Passing environments to objective functions is efficient because they are passed by reference rather than value. The con= argument passes through the populated control list, containing default values unless the key-value pairs were given in the function call (pre_eig= is extracted separately). The which= argument is 1 by default, but will also take 2 in SAC and GNM models. HSAR uses mcdet_setup() to set up Monte Carlo approximation terms. args(jacobianSetup) # function (method, env, con, pre_eig = NULL, trs = NULL, interval = NULL, # which = 1) # NULL For each value of coef, the do_ldet() function returns the log determinant, using the values stored in environment env=: args(do_ldet) # function (coef, env, which = 1) # NULL As yet the Bayesian models are limited to control argument ldet_method=\"SE_classic\" at present, using \"LU\" to generate a coarse grid of control argument nrho=200L log determinant values in the interval, spline interpolated to a finer grid of length control argument interpn=2000L, from which griddy Gibbs samples are drawn. It is hoped to add facilities to choose alternative methods in the future. This would offer possibilities to move beyond griddy Gibbs, but using gridded log determinant values seems reasonable at present. 16.3.2 Impacts Global impacts have been seen as crucial for reporting results from fitting models including the spatially lagged response (SLM, SDM, SAC. GNM) for over ten years (LeSage and Pace 2009). Extension to other models including spatially lagged covariates (SLX, SDEM) has followed (Elhorst 2010; Bivand 2012; Halleck Vega and Elhorst 2015). In order to infer from the impacts, linear combination may be used for SLX and SDEM models. For SLM, SDM, SAC and GNM models fitted with maximum likelihood or GMM, the variance-covariance matrix of the coefficients is available, and can be used to make random draws from a multivariate Normal distribution with mean set to coefficient values and variance to the estimated variance-covariance matrix. For these models fitted using Bayesian methods, draws are already available. In the SDEM case, the draws on the regression coefficients of the unlagged covariates represent direct impacts, and draws on the coefficients of the spatially lagged covariates represent indirect impacts, and their by-draw sums the total impacts. Impacts are calculated using model object class specific impacts() methods, here taking the method for \"sarlm\" objects as an example. In the sphet package, the impacts method for \"gstsls\" uses the spatialreg impacts() framework, as does the splm package for \"splm\" fitted model objects. impacts() methods require either a tr= - a vector of traces of the power series of the weights object typically computed with trW() or a listw= argument. If listw= is given, dense matrix methods are used. The evalues= argument is experimental, does not yet work for all model types, and takes the eigenvalues of the weights matrix. The R= argument gives the number of samples to be taken from the fitted model. The Q= permits the decomposition of impacts to components of the power series of the weights matrix (LeSage and Pace 2009). args(impacts.sarlm) # function (obj, ..., tr = NULL, R = NULL, listw = NULL, evalues = NULL, # useHESS = NULL, tol = 1e-06, empirical = FALSE, Q = NULL) # NULL The summary method for the output of impacts() methods where inference from samples was requested by default uses the summary() method for \"mcmc\" objects defined in the coda package. It can instead report just matrices of standard errors, z-values and p-values by setting zstats= and short= to TRUE. args(summary.lagImpact) # function (object, ..., zstats = FALSE, short = FALSE, reportQ = NULL) # NULL Since sampling is not required for inference for SLX and SDEM models, linear combination is used for models fitted using maximum likelihood; results are shown here for the air pollution variable only. The literature has not yet resolved the question of how to report model output, as each covariate is now represented by three impacts. Where spatially lagged covariates are included, two coefficients are replaced by three impacts. sum_imp_94_SDEM &lt;- summary(impacts(SDEM_94)) rbind(Impacts=sum_imp_94_SDEM$mat[5,], SE=sum_imp_94_SDEM$semat[5,]) # Direct Indirect Total # Impacts -0.01276 -0.01845 -0.0312 # SE 0.00235 0.00472 0.0053 The impacts from the same model fitted by MCMC are very similar: sum_imp_94_SDEM_B &lt;- summary(impacts(SDEM_94B)) rbind(Impacts=sum_imp_94_SDEM_B$mat[5,], SE=sum_imp_94_SDEM_B$semat[5,]) # Direct Indirect Total # Impacts -0.01276 -0.01768 -0.03044 # SE 0.00266 0.00567 0.00692 as also are those from the SLX model. In the SLX and SDEM models, the direct impacts are the consequences for the response of changes in air pollution in the same observational entity, and the indirect (local) impacts are the consequences for the response of changes in air pollution in neighbouring observational entities. sum_imp_94_SLX &lt;- summary(impacts(SLX_94)) rbind(Impacts=sum_imp_94_SLX$mat[5,], SE=sum_imp_94_SLX$semat[5,]) # Direct Indirect Total # Impacts -0.0128 -0.01874 -0.03151 # SE 0.0028 0.00556 0.00611 In contrast to local indirect impacts in SLX and SDEM models, global indirect impacts are found in models including the spatially lagged response. For purposes of exposition, let us fit an SLM: SLM_489 &lt;- lagsarlm(form, data=boston_489, listw=lw_q_489, zero.policy=TRUE) Traces of the first m= matrices of the power series in the spatial weights are pre-computed to speed up inference from samples from the fitted model, and from existing MCMC samples (LeSage and Pace 2009). The traces can also be used in other contexts too, so their pre-computation may be worthwhile anyway. The type= argument is \"mult\" by default, but may also be set to \"MC\" for Monte Carlo simulation or \"moments\" using a space-saving looping algorithm. args(trW) # function (W = NULL, m = 30, p = 16, type = &quot;mult&quot;, listw = NULL, # momentsSymmetry = TRUE) # NULL W &lt;- as(lw_q_489, &quot;CsparseMatrix&quot;) tr_489 &lt;- trW(W) str(tr_489) # num [1:30] 0 90.8 29.4 42.1 26.5 ... # - attr(*, &quot;timings&quot;)= Named num [1:2] 0.181 0.181 # ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:2] &quot;user.self&quot; &quot;elapsed&quot; # - attr(*, &quot;type&quot;)= chr &quot;mult&quot; # - attr(*, &quot;n&quot;)= int 489 In this case, the spatial process in the response is not strong, so the global indirect impacts (here for the air pollution variable) are weak.

The direct impacts agree, but the total impacts differ slightly. coef_SLM_489 &lt;- coef(SLM_489) IrW &lt;- Diagonal(489) - coef_SLM_489[1] * W S_W &lt;- solve(IrW) S_NOX_W &lt;- S_W %*% (diag(489) * coef_SLM_489[7]) c(Direct=mean(diag(S_NOX_W)), Total=sum(S_NOX_W)/489) # Direct Total # -0.00593 -0.00594 This bare-bones approach corresponds to using the listw= argument, and as expected gives the same output. sapply(impacts(SLM_489, listw=lw_q_489), &quot;[&quot;, 5) # direct indirect total # -5.93e-03 -1.01e-05 -5.94e-03 The experimental evalues= approach which is known to be numerically exact by definition gives the same results as the matrix power series trace approach, so the slight difference may be attributed to the consequences of inverting the spatial process matrix. sapply(impacts(SLM_489, evalues=eigs_489), &quot;[&quot;, 5) # direct indirect total # -5.93e-03 -1.01e-05 -5.94e-03 Impacts are crucial to the interpretation of Durbin models including spatially lagged covariates and models including the spatially lagged response. Tools to calculate impacts and their inferential bases are now available, and should be employed, but as yet some implementation details are under development and ways of presenting results in tabular form have not reached maturity. 16.3.3 Predictions We will use the predict() method for \"sarlm\" objects to double-check impacts, here for the pupil-teacher ratio (PTRATIO). The method was re-written by Martin Gubri based on Goulard, Laurent and Thomas-Agnan (2017). The pred.type= argument specifies the prediction strategy among those presented in the article. args(predict.sarlm) # function (object, newdata = NULL, listw = NULL, pred.type = &quot;TS&quot;, # all.data = FALSE, zero.policy = NULL, legacy = TRUE, legacy.mixed = FALSE, # power = NULL, order = 250, tol = .Machine$double.eps^(3/5), # spChk = NULL, ...) # NULL First we’ll increment PTRATIO by one to show that, using least squares, the mean difference between predictions from the incremented new data and fitted values is equal to the regression coefficient. nd_489 &lt;- boston_489 nd_489$PTRATIO &lt;- nd_489$PTRATIO + 1 OLS_489 &lt;- lm(form, data=boston_489) fitted &lt;- predict(OLS_489) nd_fitted &lt;- predict(OLS_489, newdata=nd_489) all.equal(unname(coef(OLS_489)[12]), mean(nd_fitted - fitted)) # [1] TRUE In models including the spatially lagged response, and when the spatial coefficient in different from zero, this is not the case in general, and is why we need impacts() methods. The difference here is not great, but neither is it zero, and needs to be handled. fitted &lt;- predict(SLM_489) # This method assumes the response is known - see manual page nd_fitted &lt;- predict(SLM_489, newdata=nd_489, listw=lw_q_489, pred.type=&quot;TS&quot;, zero.policy=TRUE) all.equal(unname(coef_SLM_489[13]), mean(nd_fitted - fitted)) # [1] &quot;Mean relative difference: 0.00178&quot; In the Boston tracts data set, 17 observations of median house values, the response, are censored. Using these as an example and comparing some pred.type= variants for the SDEM model and predicting out-of-sample, we can see that there are differences, suggesting that this is a fruitful area for study. There have been a number of alternative proposals for handling missing variables (Gómez-Rubio, Bivand, and Rue 2015; Suesse 2018). Another reason for increasing attention on prediction is that it is fundamental for machine learning approaches, in which prediction for validation and test data sets drives model specification choice. The choice of training and other data sets with dependent spatial data remains an open question, and is certainly not as simple as with independent data. Here, we’ll list the predictions for the censored tract observations using three different prediction types, taking the exponent to get back to the USD median house values. nd &lt;- boston_506[is.na(boston_506$median),] t0 &lt;- exp(predict(SDEM_489, newdata=nd, listw=lw_q, pred.type=&quot;TS&quot;, zero.policy=TRUE)) suppressWarnings(t1 &lt;- exp(predict(SDEM_489, newdata=nd, listw=lw_q, pred.type=&quot;KP2&quot;, zero.policy=TRUE))) suppressWarnings(t2 &lt;- exp(predict(SDEM_489, newdata=nd, listw=lw_q, pred.type=&quot;KP5&quot;, zero.policy=TRUE))) data.frame(fit_TS=t0[,1], fit_KP2=c(t1), fit_KP5=c(t2), censored=boston_506$censored[as.integer(attr(t0, &quot;region.id&quot;))]) # fit_TS fit_KP2 fit_KP5 censored # 13 23912 29477 28147 right # 14 28126 27001 28516 right # 15 30553 36184 32476 right # 17 18518 19621 18878 right # 43 9564 6817 7561 left # 50 8371 7196 7383 left # 312 51477 53301 54173 right # 313 45921 45823 47095 right # 314 44196 44586 45361 right # 317 43427 45707 45442 right # 337 39879 42072 41127 right # 346 44708 46694 46108 right # 355 48188 49068 48911 right # 376 42881 45883 44966 right # 408 44294 44615 45670 right # 418 38211 43375 41914 right # 434 41647 41690 42398 right 16.4 Markov random field and multilevel models with spatial weights There is a large literature in spatial epidemiology using CAR and ICAR models in spatially structured random effects. These extend to multilevel models, in which the spatially structured random effects may apply at different levels of the model (Roger S. Bivand et al. 2017). In order to try out some of the variants, we need to remove the no-neighbour observations from the tract level, and from the model output zone aggregated level, in two steps as reducing the tract level induces a no-neighbour outcome at the model output zone level. boston_94a &lt;- aggregate(boston_489[,&quot;NOX_ID&quot;], list(boston_489$NOX_ID), unique) nb_q_94a &lt;- spdep::poly2nb(boston_94a) NOX_ID_no_neighs &lt;- boston_94a$NOX_ID[which(spdep::card(nb_q_94a) == 0)] boston_487 &lt;- boston_489[is.na(match(boston_489$NOX_ID, NOX_ID_no_neighs)),] boston_93 &lt;- aggregate(boston_487[, &quot;NOX_ID&quot;], list(ids = boston_487$NOX_ID), unique) row.names(boston_93) &lt;- as.character(boston_93$NOX_ID) nb_q_93 &lt;- spdep::poly2nb(boston_93, row.names=unique(as.character(boston_93$NOX_ID))) The lme4 package lets us add an IID unstructured random effect at the model output zone level: library(lme4) MLM &lt;- lmer(update(form, . ~ . + (1 | NOX_ID)), data=boston_487, REML=FALSE) copying the random effect into the \"sf\" object for mapping below. boston_93$MLM_re &lt;- ranef(MLM)[[1]][,1] Two packages, hglm and HSAR, offer SAR upper level spatially structured random effects, and require the specification of a sparse matrix mapping the upper level enities onto lower level entities, and sparse binary weights matrices: library(Matrix) suppressMessages(library(MatrixModels)) Delta &lt;- as(model.Matrix(~ -1 + as.factor(NOX_ID), data=boston_487, sparse=TRUE), &quot;dgCMatrix&quot;) M &lt;- as(spdep::nb2listw(nb_q_93, style=&quot;B&quot;), &quot;CsparseMatrix&quot;) The extension of hglm to sparse spatial setting extended its facilities (Alam, Rönnegård, and Shen 2015), and also permits the modelling of discrete responses. First we fit an IID random effect: suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(hglm)) y_hglm &lt;- log(boston_487$median) X_hglm &lt;- model.matrix(lm(form, data=boston_487)) suppressWarnings(HGLM_iid &lt;- hglm(y=y_hglm, X=X_hglm, Z=Delta)) followed by a SAR model at the upper level (corresponding to a spatial error (SEM) model), which reports the spatially structured random effect without fully converging, so coefficient standard errors are not available: suppressWarnings(HGLM_sar &lt;- hglm(y=y_hglm, X=X_hglm, Z=Delta, rand.family=SAR(D=M))) boston_93$HGLM_re &lt;- unname(HGLM_iid$ranef) boston_93$HGLM_ss &lt;- HGLM_sar$ranef[,1] The HSAR package is restricted to the Gaussian response case, and fits an upper level SEM using MCMC; if W= is a lower level weights matrix, it will also fit a lower level SLM (Dong and Harris 2015; Dong et al. 2015): library(HSAR) suppressWarnings(HSAR &lt;- hsar(form, data=boston_487, W=NULL, M=M, Delta=Delta, burnin=500, Nsim=2500, thinning=1)) boston_93$HSAR_ss &lt;- HSAR$Mus[1,] The R2BayesX package provides flexible support for structured additive regression models, including spatial multilevel models. The models include an IID unstructured random effect at the upper level using the \"re\" specification (Umlauf et al. 2015); we choose the \"MCMC\"method: suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(R2BayesX)) BX_iid &lt;- bayesx(update(form, . ~ . + sx(NOX_ID, bs=&quot;re&quot;)), family=&quot;gaussian&quot;, data=boston_487, method=&quot;MCMC&quot;, iterations=12000, burnin=2000, step=2, seed=123) # Warning in run.bayesx(file.path(res$bayesx.prg$file.dir, prg.name = # res$bayesx.prg$prg.name), : an error occurred during runtime of BayesX, please # check the BayesX logfile! boston_93$BX_re &lt;- BX_iid$effects[&quot;sx(NOX_ID):re&quot;][[1]]$Mean and the \"mrf\" (Markov random field) spatially structured random effect specification based on a graph derived from converting a suitable \"nb\" object for the upper level. The \"region.id\" attribute of the \"nb\" object needs to contain values corresponding the the indexing variable. RBX_gra &lt;- nb2gra(nb_q_93) BX_mrf &lt;- bayesx(update(form, . ~ . + sx(NOX_ID, bs=&quot;mrf&quot;, map=RBX_gra)), family=&quot;gaussian&quot;, data=boston_487, method=&quot;MCMC&quot;, iterations=12000, burnin=2000,step=2, seed=123) # Warning in run.bayesx(file.path(res$bayesx.prg$file.dir, prg.name = # res$bayesx.prg$prg.name), : an error occurred during runtime of BayesX, please # check the BayesX logfile! boston_93$BX_ss &lt;- BX_mrf$effects[&quot;sx(NOX_ID):mrf&quot;][[1]]$Mean In a very similar way, mgcv::gam() can take an \"mrf\" term using a suitable \"nb\" object for the upper level. In this case the \"nb\" object needs to have the contents of the \"region.id\" attribute copied as the names of the neighbour list components, and the indexing variable needs to be a factor (Wood 2017) (the \"REML\" method of bayesx() gives the same result here): library(mgcv) names(nb_q_93) &lt;- attr(nb_q_93, &quot;region.id&quot;) boston_487$NOX_ID &lt;- as.factor(boston_487$NOX_ID) GAM_MRF &lt;- gam(update(form, . ~ . + s(NOX_ID, bs=&quot;mrf&quot;, xt=list(nb=nb_q_93))), data=boston_487, method=&quot;REML&quot;) boston_93$GAM_ss &lt;- aggregate(predict(GAM_MRF, type=&quot;terms&quot;, se=FALSE)[,14], list(boston_487$NOX_ID), mean)$x In the cases of hglm(), bayesx() and gam(), we could also model discrete responses without further major difficulty, and bayesx() and gam() also facilitate the generalization of functional form fitting for included covariates. res &lt;- rbind(iid_lmer=summary(MLM)$coefficients[6, 1:2], iid_hglm=summary(HGLM_iid)$FixCoefMat[6, 1:2], iid_BX=BX_iid$fixed.effects[6, 1:2], sar_hsar=c(HSAR$Mbetas[1, 6], HSAR$SDbetas[1, 6]), mrf_BX=BX_mrf$fixed.effects[6, 1:2], mrf_GAM=c(summary(GAM_MRF)$p.coeff[6], summary(GAM_MRF)$se[6])) Unfortunately, the coefficient estimates for the air pollution variable for these multilevel models are not helpful. All remain negative, but the inclusion of the model output zone level effects, be they IID or spatially structured, suggest that it is hard to disentangle the influence of the scale of observation from that of covariates observed at that scale. suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2)) df_res &lt;- as.data.frame(res) names(df_res) &lt;- c(&quot;mean&quot;, &quot;sd&quot;) limits &lt;- aes(ymax = mean + qnorm(0.975)*sd, ymin=mean + qnorm(0.025)*sd) df_res$model &lt;- row.names(df_res) p &lt;- ggplot(df_res, aes(y=mean, x=model)) + geom_point() + geom_errorbar(limits) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col=&quot;#EB811B&quot;) + coord_flip() p + ggtitle(&quot;NOX coefficients and error bars&quot;) + theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;transparent&quot;,colour = NA), legend.background = element_rect(colour = NA, fill = &quot;transparent&quot;)) Figure 16.1: Polish municipality types 2015 This map shows that the model output zone level IID random effects are very similar across the three model fitting functions reported. library(tmap) # FIXME: uncommented BX_re tm_shape(boston_93) + tm_fill(c(&quot;MLM_re&quot;, &quot;HGLM_re&quot; #, &quot;BX_re&quot; ), midpoint=0, title=&quot;IID&quot;) + tm_facets(free.scales=FALSE) + tm_borders(lwd=0.3, alpha=0.4) + tm_layout(panel.labels=c(&quot;MLM&quot;, &quot;HGLM&quot;, &quot;BX&quot;)) Figure 16.2: IID random effects The spatially structured SAR and MRF random effects (MRF term in the gam() case) are also very similar, with the MRF somewhat less smoothed than the SAR values. # FIXME: uncommented BX_ss tm_shape(boston_93) + tm_fill(c(&quot;HGLM_ss&quot;, &quot;HSAR_ss&quot;, # &quot;BX_ss&quot;, &quot;GAM_ss&quot;), midpoint=0, title=&quot;SS&quot;) + tm_facets(free.scales=FALSE) + tm_borders(lwd=0.3, alpha=0.4) + tm_layout(panel.labels=c(&quot;HGLM SAR&quot;, &quot;HSAR SAR&quot;, &quot;BX MRF&quot;, &quot;GAM MRF&quot;)) Figure 16.3: Spatially structured random effects Although there is still a great need for more thorough comparative studies of model fitting functions for spatial regression, there has been much progress over recent years.

Like nested function calls, it avoids the need to choose names for intermediate results. 19.5 Data structures As pointed out by (Chambers 2016), everything that exists in R is an object. This includes objects that make things happen, such as language objects or functions, but also the more basic “things”, such as data objects. Some basic R data structures will now be discussed. 19.5.1 Homogeneous vectors Data objects contain data, and possibly metadata. Data is always in the form of a vector, which can have different type. We can find the type by typeof, and vector length by length. Vectors are created by c, which combines individual elements: typeof(1:10) # [1] &quot;integer&quot; length(1:10) # [1] 10 typeof(1.0) # [1] &quot;double&quot; length(1.0) # [1] 1 typeof(c(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;)) # [1] &quot;character&quot; length(c(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;)) # [1] 2 typeof(c(TRUE, FALSE)) # [1] &quot;logical&quot; Vectors of this kind can only have a single type. Note that vectors can have length zero, e.g. in, i = integer(0) typeof(i) # [1] &quot;integer&quot; i # integer(0) length(i) # [1] 0 We can retrieve (or in assignments: replace) elements in a vector using [ or [[: a = c(1,2,3) a[2] # [1] 2 a[[2]] # [1] 2 a[2:3] # [1] 2 3 a[2:3] = c(5,6) a # [1] 1 5 6 a[[3]] = 10 a # [1] 1 5 10 where the difference is that [ can operate on an index range (or multiple indexes), and [[ operates on a single vector value. 19.5.2 Heterogeneous vectors: list An additional vector type is the list, which can combine any types in its elements: l &lt;- list(3, TRUE, &quot;foo&quot;) typeof(l) # [1] &quot;list&quot; length(l) # [1] 3 For lists, there is a further distinction between [ and [[: the single [ returns always a list, and [[ returns the contents of a list element: l[1] # [[1]] # [1] 3 l[[1]] # [1] 3 For replacement, one case use [ when providing a list, and [[ when providing a new value: l[1:2] = list(4, FALSE) l # [[1]] # [1] 4 # # [[2]] # [1] FALSE # # [[3]] # [1] &quot;foo&quot; l[[3]] = &quot;bar&quot; l # [[1]] # [1] 4 # # [[2]] # [1] FALSE # # [[3]] # [1] &quot;bar&quot; In case list elements are named, as in l = list(first = 3, second = TRUE, third = &quot;foo&quot;) l # $first # [1] 3 # # $second # [1] TRUE # # $third # [1] &quot;foo&quot; we can use names as in l[[\"second\"]] and this can be abbreviated to l$second # [1] TRUE l$second = FALSE l # $first # [1] 3 # # $second # [1] FALSE # # $third # [1] &quot;foo&quot; This is convenient, but also requires name look-up in the names attribute (see below). 19.5.2.1 NULL and removing list elements NULL is the null value in R; it is special in the sense that it doesn’t work in simple comparisons: 3 == NULL # not FALSE! # logical(0) NULL == NULL # not even TRUE! # logical(0) but has to be treated specially, using is.null: is.null(NULL) # [1] TRUE When we want to remove one or more list elements, we can do so by creating a new list that does not contain the elements that needed removal, as in l = l[c(1,3)] # remove second, implicitly l # $first # [1] 3 # # $third # [1] &quot;foo&quot; but we can also assign NULL to the element we want to eliminate: l$second = NULL l # $first # [1] 3 # # $third # [1] &quot;foo&quot; 19.5.3 Attributes We can glue arbitrary metadata objects to data objects, as in a = 1:3 attr(a, &quot;some_meta_data&quot;) = &quot;foo&quot; a # [1] 1 2 3 # attr(,&quot;some_meta_data&quot;) # [1] &quot;foo&quot; and this can be retrieved, or replaced by attr(a, &quot;some_meta_data&quot;) # [1] &quot;foo&quot; attr(a, &quot;some_meta_data&quot;) = &quot;bar&quot; attr(a, &quot;some_meta_data&quot;) # [1] &quot;bar&quot; In essence, the attribute of an object is a named list, and we can get or set the complete list by attributes(a) # $some_meta_data # [1] &quot;bar&quot; attributes(a) = list(some_meta_data = &quot;foo&quot;) attributes(a) # $some_meta_data # [1] &quot;foo&quot; A number of attributes are treated specially by R, see e.g. ?attributes. 19.5.3.1 object class and class attribute Every object in R “has a class”, meaning that class(obj) returns a character vector with the class of obj. Some objects have an implicit class, e.g. vectors class(1:3) # [1] &quot;integer&quot; class(c(TRUE, FALSE)) # [1] &quot;logical&quot; class(c(&quot;TRUE&quot;, &quot;FALSE&quot;)) # [1] &quot;character&quot; but we can also set the class explicit, either by using attr or by using class in the left-hand side of an expression: a = 1:3 class(a) = &quot;foo&quot; a # [1] 1 2 3 # attr(,&quot;class&quot;) # [1] &quot;foo&quot; class(a) # [1] &quot;foo&quot; attributes(a) # $class # [1] &quot;foo&quot; in which case the newly set class overrides the earlier implicit class. This way, we can add methods for class foo, e.g. by print.foo = function(x, ...) print(paste(&quot;an object of class foo with length&quot;, length(x))) print(a) # [1] &quot;an object of class foo with length 3&quot; Providing such methods are generally intended to create more usable software, but at the same time they may make the objects more opaque. It is sometimes useful to see what an object “is made of” by printing it after the class attribute is removed, as in unclass(a) # [1] 1 2 3 As a more elaborate example, consider the case where a polygon is made using package sf: library(sf) p = st_polygon(list(rbind(c(0,0), c(1,0), c(1,1), c(0,0)))) p # POLYGON ((0 0, 1 0, 1 1, 0 0)) which prints the well-known-text form; to understand what the data structure is like, we can use unclass(p) # [[1]] # [,1] [,2] # [1,] 0 0 # [2,] 1 0 # [3,] 1 1 # [4,] 0 0 19.5.3.2 the dim attribute The dim attribute sets the matrix or array dimensions: a = 1:8 class(a) # [1] &quot;integer&quot; attr(a, &quot;dim&quot;) = c(2,4) # or: dim(a) = c(2,4) class(a) # [1] &quot;matrix&quot; &quot;array&quot; a # [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] # [1,] 1 3 5 7 # [2,] 2 4 6 8 attr(a, &quot;dim&quot;) = c(2,2,2) # or: dim(a) = c(2,2,2) class(a) # [1] &quot;array&quot; a # , , 1 # # [,1] [,2] # [1,] 1 3 # [2,] 2 4 # # , , 2 # # [,1] [,2] # [1,] 5 7 # [2,] 6 8 19.5.4 various names attributes Named vectors carry their names in a names attribute. We saw examples for lists above, an example for a numeric vector is: a = c(first = 3, second = 4, last = 5) a[&quot;second&quot;] # second # 4 attributes(a) # $names # [1] &quot;first&quot; &quot;second&quot; &quot;last&quot; More name attributes are e.g. dimnames of matrices or arrays, which not only names dimensions, but also the labels associated with each of the dimensions: a = matrix(1:4, 2, 2) dimnames(a) = list(rows = c(&quot;row1&quot;, &quot;row2&quot;), cols = c(&quot;col1&quot;, &quot;col2&quot;)) a # cols # rows col1 col2 # row1 1 3 # row2 2 4 attributes(a) # $dim # [1] 2 2 # # $dimnames # $dimnames$rows # [1] &quot;row1&quot; &quot;row2&quot; # # $dimnames$cols # [1] &quot;col1&quot; &quot;col2&quot; Data.frame objects have rows and columns, and each have names: df = data.frame(a = 1:3, b = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)) attributes(df) # $names # [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; # # $class # [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; # # $row.names # [1] 1 2 3 19.5.5 using structure When programming, the pattern of adding or modifying attributes before returning an object is extremely common, an example being: f = function(x) { a = create_obj(x) # call some other function attributes(a) = list(class = &quot;foo&quot;, meta = 33) a } The last two statements can be contracted in f = function(x) { a = create_obj(x) # call some other function structure(a, class = &quot;foo&quot;, meta = 33) } where function structure adds, replaces, or (in case of value NULL) removes attributes from the object in its first argument.
