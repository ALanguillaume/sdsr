should st_is_longlat() return an error in case of st_point(c(0,95))?

answer: yes/no. In theory, longitude is in principle circular,
and could go on infinitely: we could add an arbitrary times 360
degrees and end up with the same geometry. Why should latitude not
have this property?  But when does the rest of the software stop
working when we do this?  Proposal: generate a warning if long
outside [-180,360], and/or lat outside [-90,90].
-> now added to sf, try

 st_is_longlat(st_sfc(st_point(c(0,-95)), crs = 4326))


[comment]: FIXME should we mention the geometry invalidity problem here, as it is often found when carrying out intersection operations?

  in ch 6: added ref to new ch 5 section on invalid geometries caused by st_intersection.


[comment]: FIXME do we need references to your "meaningful" article, and to area-weighted interpolation articles?

  done: last paragraph of 6.1

[comment]: FIXME do we need to distinguish WKT1 and WKT2 with regard to form and treatment of authority - do we need to foreshadow the new SQLite-based systems? 

  added at the place where WKT is mentioned, that changes are expected soon.
